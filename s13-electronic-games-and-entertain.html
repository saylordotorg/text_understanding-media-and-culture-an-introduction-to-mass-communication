        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s00_p01">Video games have come a long way from using a simple joystick to guide Pac-Man on his mission to find food and avoid ghosts. This is illustrated by a 2007 Southwest Airlines commercial in which two friends are playing a baseball video game on a Nintendo Wii–like console. The batting friend tells the other to throw his pitch—and he does, excitedly firing his controller into the middle of the plasma television, which then falls off the wall. Both friends stare in shock at the shattered flat screen as the narrator asks, “Want to get away?”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s00_p02">Such a scene is unlikely to have taken place in the early days of video games when Atari reigned supreme and the action of playing solely centered on hand-eye coordination. The learning curve was relatively nonexistent; players maneuvered a joystick to shoot lines of aliens in the sky, or they turned the wheel on a paddle to play a virtual game of table tennis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s00_p03">But as video games became increasingly popular, they also became increasingly complex. Consoles upgraded and evolved on a regular basis, and the games kept up. Players called each other with loopholes and tips on how to get Mario and Luigi onto the next level, and now they exchange their tricks on gaming blogs. Games like <em class="emphasis">The Legend of Zelda</em> and <em class="emphasis">Final Fantasy</em> created alternate worlds and intricate story lines, providing multiple-hour epic adventures.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s00_p04">Long criticized for taking kids out of the backyard and into a sedentary spot in front of the television, many video games have circled back to their simpler origins and, in doing so, have made players more active. Casual gamers who could quickly figure out how to put together puzzle pieces in <em class="emphasis">Tetris</em> can now just as easily figure out how to “swing” a tennis racket with a Wiimote. Video games are no longer a convenient scapegoat for America’s obesity problems; <em class="emphasis">Wii Fit</em> offers everything from yoga to boxing, and <em class="emphasis">Dance Dance Revolution</em> estimates calories burned while players dance.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s00_p05">The logistics of video games continue to change, and as they do, gaming has begun to intersect with every other part of culture. Players can learn how to “perform” their favorite songs with <em class="emphasis">Guitar Hero</em> and <em class="emphasis">Rock Band</em>. Product placement akin to what is seen in movies and on television is equally prevalent in video games such as the popular <em class="emphasis">Forza Motorsport</em> or <em class="emphasis">FIFA</em> series. As the Internet allows for players across the world to participate simultaneously, video games have the potential to one day look like competitive reality shows.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_001">Michael Dolan, “The Video Game Revolution: The Future of Video Gaming,” <em class="emphasis">PBS</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/future.html">http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/future.html</a>.</span> Arguably, video games even hold a place in the art world, with the increasing complexity of animation and story lines.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_002">Jona Tres Kap, “The Video Game Revolution: But is it Art?” <em class="emphasis">PBS</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/art.html">http://www.pbs.org/kcts/videogamerevolution/impact/art.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s00_p06">And now, with endless possibilities for the future, video games are attracting new and different demographics. Avid players who grew up with video games may be the first ones to purchase 3-D televisions for the 3-D games of the future.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_003">M. H. Williams, “Study Shows Casual and Core Gamers Are Ready for 3-D Gaming,” Industry Gamers, June 15, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.industrygamers.com/news/study-shows-casual-and-core-gamers-are-ready-for-3d-gaming/">http://www.industrygamers.com/news/study-shows-casual-and-core-gamers-are-ready-for-3d-gaming/</a>.</span> But casual players, perhaps of an older demographic, will be drawn to the simplicity of a game like <em class="emphasis">Wii Bowling</em>. Video games have become more accessible than ever. Social media websites like Facebook offer free video game applications, and smartphone users can download apps for as little as a dollar, literally putting video games in one’s back pocket. Who needs a cumbersome Scrabble board when it’s available on a touch screen anytime, anywhere?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s00_p07">Video games have become ubiquitous in modern culture. Understanding them as a medium allows a fuller understanding of their implications in the realms of entertainment, information, and communication. Studying their history reveals new perspectives on the ways video games have affected mainstream culture.</p>

However, the precursors to modern video games were created as early as the 1950s. In 1952 a computer simulation of tic-tac-toe was developed for EDSAC, one of the first stored-information computers, and in 1958 a game called <em class="emphasis">Tennis for Two</em> was developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a way to entertain people coming through the laboratory on tours.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_004">Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen, <em class="emphasis">Understanding Video Games: The Essential Introduction</em> (New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2008), 50.</span></p>

In a time before personal computers, these games allowed the general public to access technology that had been restricted to the realm of abstract science. <em class="emphasis">Tennis for Two</em> created an interface where anyone with basic motor skills could use a complex machine. The first video games functioned early on as a form of media by essentially disseminating the experience of computer technology to those who did not have access to it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_p03">As video games evolved, their role as a form of media grew as well.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_p01">The 1970s saw the rise of video games as a cultural phenomenon. A 1972 article in <em class="emphasis">Rolling Stone</em> describes the early days of computer gaming:</p>

Atari, which was making arcade games at the time, decided to produce a home version of <em class="emphasis">Pong</em> and released it in 1974. Although this system could only play one game, its graphics and controls were superior to the Odyssey, and it was sold through a major department store, Sears. Because of these advantages, the Atari home version of <em class="emphasis">Pong</em> sold well, and a host of other companies began producing and selling their own versions of <em class="emphasis">Pong</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_007">Leonard Herman, “Early Home Video Game Systems,” in <em class="emphasis">The Video Game Explosion: From Pong to PlayStation and Beyond</em>, ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p02">A major step forward in the evolution of video games was the development of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">game cartridges</a><span class="glossdef">Interchangeable cartridges containing video games for use in home consoles.</span></span> that stored the games and could be interchanged in the console. With this technology, users were no longer limited to a set number of games, leading many video game console makers to switch their emphasis to producing games. Several groups, such as Magnavox, Coleco, and Fairchild, released versions of cartridge-type consoles, but Atari’s 2600 console had the upper hand because of the company’s work on arcade games. Atari capitalized off of its arcade successes by releasing games that were well known to a public that was frequenting arcades. The popularity of games such as <em class="emphasis">Space Invaders</em> and <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> made the Atari 2600 a successful system. The late 1970s also saw the birth of companies such as Activision, which developed third-party games for the Atari 2600.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_008">Mark J. P.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s03_p01">The birth of the home computer market in the 1970s paralleled the emergence of video game consoles. The first computer designed and sold for the home consumer was the Altair. It was first sold in 1975, several years after video game consoles had been selling, and it sold mainly to a hobbyist market. During this period, people such as Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, were building computers by hand and selling them to get their start-up businesses going. In 1977, three important computers—Radio Shack’s TRS-80, the Commodore PET, and the Apple II—were produced and began selling to the home market.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_009">Jeremy Reimer, “Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures,” <em class="emphasis">Ars Technica</em> (blog), December 14, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/total-share.ars/2">http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/total-share.ars/2</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s03_p02">The rise of personal computers allowed for the development of more complex games. Designers of games such as <em class="emphasis">Mystery House</em>, developed in 1979 for the Apple II, and <em class="emphasis">Rogue</em>, developed in 1980 and played on IBM PCs, used the processing power of early home computers to develop video games that had extended plots and story lines. In these games, players moved through landscapes composed of basic graphics, solving problems and working through an involved narrative. The development of video games for the personal computer platform expanded the ability of video games to act as media by allowing complex stories to be told and new forms of interaction to take place between players.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p01">Atari’s success in the home console market was due in large part to its ownership of already-popular arcade games and the large number of game cartridges available for the system. These strengths, however, eventually proved detrimental to the company and led to what is now known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">video game crash of 1983</a><span class="glossdef">The economic failure of the video game industry in 1983, caused by an oversupply of games and waning demand.</span></span>. Atari bet heavily on its past successes with popular arcade games by releasing <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> for the Atari 2600. <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> was a successful arcade game that did not translate well to the home console, leading to disappointed consumers and lower-than-expected sales. Additionally, Atari produced 10 million of the lackluster <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> games on its first run, despite the fact that active consoles were only estimated at 10 million. Similar mistakes were made with a game based on the movie <em class="emphasis">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</em>, which has gained notoriety as one of the worst games in Atari’s history. It was not received well by consumers despite the success of the movie, and Atari had again bet heavily on its success. Piles of unsold <em class="emphasis">E.T.</em> game cartridges were reportedly buried in the New Mexico desert under a veil of secrecy.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_010">Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost, <em class="emphasis">Racing the Beam</em>: <em class="emphasis">The Atari Video Computer System</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009), 127.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p02">As retail outlets became increasingly wary of home console failures, they began stocking fewer games on shelves. This action, combined with an increasing number of companies producing games, led to overproduction and a resulting fallout in the video game market in 1983. Many smaller game developers did not have the capacity to withstand this downturn and went out of business. Although Coleco and Atari were able to make it through the crash, neither company regained its former share of the video game market. It was 1985 when the video game market picked up again.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_011">Steven Kent, “Super Mario Nation,” <em class="emphasis">American Heritage</em>, September 1997, <a class="link" href="http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1997/5/1997_5_65.shtml">http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1997/5/1997_5_65.shtml</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p01">Nintendo, a Japanese card and novelty producer that had begun to produce electronic games in the 1970s, was responsible for arcade games such as <em class="emphasis">Donkey Kong</em> in the early 1980s. Its first home console, developed in 1984 for sale in Japan, tried to succeed where Atari had failed. The Nintendo system used newer, better microchips, bought in large quantities, to ensure high-quality graphics at a price consumers could afford. Keeping console prices low meant Nintendo had to rely on games for most of its profits and maintain control of game production. This was something Atari had failed to do, and it led to a glut of low-priced games that caused the crash of 1983. Nintendo got around this problem with proprietary circuits that would not allow unlicensed games to be played on the console. This allowed Nintendo to dominate the home video game market through the end of the decade, when one-third of homes in the United States had a Nintendo system.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_012">Gary Cross and Gregory Smits, “Japan, the U.S. and the Globalization of Children’s Consumer Culture,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social History</em> 38, no. 4 (2005).</span></p>

The game <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Brothers</em>, released with the system, was also a landmark in video game development. The game employed a narrative in the same manner as more complicated computer games, but its controls were accessible and its objectives simple.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p03">As video games developed as a form of media, the public struggled to come to grips with the kind of messages this medium was passing on to children. These were no longer simple games of reflex that could be compared to similar non-video games or sports; these were forms of media that included stories and messages that concerned parents and children’s advocates. Arguments about the larger meaning of the games became common, with some seeing the games as driven by ideas of conquest and gender stereotypes, whereas others saw basic stories about traveling and exploration.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_015">Mary Fuller and Henry Jenkins, “Nintendo and New World Travel Writing: A Dialogue,” <em class="emphasis">Cybersociety: Computer-Mediated Communication and Community</em>, ed.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Computer Games Flourish and Innovate</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p01">The enormous number of games available for Atari consoles in the early 1980s took its toll on video arcades. In 1983, arcade revenues had fallen to a 3-year low, leading game makers to turn to newer technologies that could not be replicated by home consoles. This included arcade games powered by laser discs, such as <em class="emphasis">Dragon’s Lair</em> and <em class="emphasis">Space Ace</em>, but their novelty soon wore off, and laser-disc games became museum pieces.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_017">Aljean Harmetz, “Video Arcades Turn to Laser Technology as Queues Dwindle,” <em class="emphasis">Morning Herald</em> (Sydney), February 2, 1984.</span> In 1989, museums were already putting on exhibitions of early arcade games that included ones from the early 1980s. Although newer games continued to come out on arcade platforms, they could not compete with the home console market and never achieved their previous successes from the early 1980s. Increasingly, arcade gamers chose to stay at home to play games on computers and consoles. Today, dedicated arcades are a dying breed. Most that remain, like the Dave &amp; Buster’s and Chuck E. Cheese’s chains, offer full-service restaurants and other entertainment attractions to draw in business.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p02">Home games fared better than arcades because they could ride the wave of personal computer purchases that occurred in the 1980s. Some important developments in video games occurred in the mid-1980s with the development of online games. Multiuser dungeons, or MUDs, were role-playing games played online by multiple users at once. The games were generally text-based, describing the world of the MUD through text rather than illustrating it through graphics. The games allowed users to create a character and move through different worlds, accomplishing goals that awarded them with new skills. If characters attained a certain level of proficiency, they could then design their own area of the world. <em class="emphasis">Habitat</em>, a game developed in 1986 for the Commodore 64, was a graphic version of this type of game. Users dialed up on modems to a central host server and then controlled characters on screen, interacting with other users. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_018">Jeremy Reimer, “The Evolution of Gaming: Computers, Consoles, and Arcade,” <em class="emphasis">Ars Technica</em> (blog), October 10, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/10/gaming-evolution.ars/4">http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/10/gaming-evolution.ars/4</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p03">During the mid-1980s, a demographic shift occurred. Between 1985 and 1987, games designed to run on business computers rose from 15 percent to 40 percent of games sold.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_019">Philip Elmer-Dewitt and others, “Computers: Games that Grownups Play,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, July 27, 1987, <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965090,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965090,00.html</a>.</span> This trend meant that game makers could use the increased processing power of business computers to create more complex games. It also meant adults were interested in computer games and could become a profitable market.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_p01">Video games evolved at a rapid rate throughout the 1990s, moving from the first 16-bit systems (named for the amount of data they could process and store) in the early ’90s to the first Internet-enabled home console in 1999. As companies focused on new marketing strategies, wider audiences were targeted, and video games’ influence on culture began to be felt.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s01_p01">Nintendo’s dominance of the home console market throughout the late 1980s allowed it to build a large library of games for use on the NES. This also proved to be a weakness, however, because Nintendo was reluctant to improve or change its system for fear of making its game library obsolete. Technology had changed in the years since the introduction of the NES, and companies such as NEC and Sega were ready to challenge Nintendo with 16-bit systems.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_020">Andy Slaven, <em class="emphasis">Video Game Bible, 1985–2002</em>, (Victoria, BC: Trafford), 70–71.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s01_p02">The Sega Master System had failed to challenge the NES, but with the release of its 16-bit system, Sega Genesis, the company pursued a new marketing strategy. Whereas Nintendo targeted 8- to 14-year-olds, Sega’s marketing plan targeted 15- to 17-year olds, making games that were more mature and advertising during programs such as the MTV Video Music Awards. The campaign successfully branded Sega as a cooler version of Nintendo and moved mainstream video games into a more mature arena. Nintendo responded to the Sega Genesis with its own 16-bit system, the Super NES, and began creating more mature games as well. Games such as Sega’s <em class="emphasis">Mortal Kombat</em> and Nintendo’s <em class="emphasis">Street Fighter</em> competed to raise the level of violence possible in a video game. Sega’s advertisements even suggested that its game was better because of its more violent possibilities.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_021">Gamespot, “When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy,” <a class="link" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/p-5.html">http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/p-5.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s01_p03">By 1994, companies such as 3DO, with its 32-bit system, and Atari, with its allegedly 64-bit Jaguar, attempted to get in on the home console market but failed to use effective marketing strategies to back up their products. Both systems fell out of production before the end of the decade. Sega, fearing that its system would become obsolete, released the 32-bit Saturn system in 1995. The system was rushed into production and did not have enough games available to ensure its success.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_022"><a class="link" href="http://CyberiaPC.com">CyberiaPC.com</a>, “Sega Saturn (History, Specs, Pictures),” <a class="link" href="http://www.cyberiapc.com/vgg/sega_saturn.htm">http://www.cyberiapc.com/vgg/sega_saturn.htm</a>.</span> Sony stepped in with its PlayStation console at a time when Sega’s Saturn was floundering and before Nintendo’s 64-bit system had been released. This system targeted an even older demographic of 14- to 24-year-olds and made a large effect on the market; by March of 2007, Sony had sold 102 million PlayStations.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_023">Edge staff, “The Making Of: Playstation,” <em class="emphasis">Edge</em>, April 24, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-playstation">http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-playstation</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s04_p01">The development of portable game systems was another important aspect of video games during the 1990s. Handheld games had been in use since the 1970s, and a system with interchangeable cartridges had even been sold in the early 1980s. Nintendo released the Game Boy in 1989, using the same principles that made the NES dominate the handheld market throughout the 1990s. The Game Boy was released with the game <em class="emphasis">Tetris</em>, using the game’s popularity to drive purchases of the unit. The unit’s simple design meant users could get 20 hours of playing time on a set of batteries, and this basic design was left essentially unaltered for most of the decade. More advanced handheld systems, such as the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear, could not compete with the Game Boy despite their superior graphics and color displays. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_026">Joe Hutsko, “88 Million and Counting; Nintendo Remains King of the Handheld Game Players,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 25, 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s04_p02">The decade-long success of the Game Boy belies the conventional wisdom of the console wars that more advanced technology makes for a more popular system. The Game Boy’s static, simple design was readily accessible, and its stability allowed for a large library of games to be developed for it. Despite using technology almost a decade old, the Game Boy accounted for 30 percent of Nintendo of America’s overall revenues at the end of the 1990s. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_027">Joe Hutsko, “88 Million and Counting; Nintendo Remains King of the Handheld Game Players,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 25, 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html</a>.</span></p>

This console could connect to the Internet, emulating the sophisticated computer games of the 1990s. The new features of the Sega Dreamcast were not enough to save the brand, however, and Sega discontinued production in 2001, leaving the console market entirely.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_028">“Sega Dreamcast,” slide in “A Brief History of Game Console Warfare,” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, <a class="link" href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/">http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_s01_p02">A major problem for Sega’s Dreamcast was Sony’s release of the PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2000.

The Xbox was an attempt by Microsoft to enter the market with a console that expanded on the functions of other game consoles. The unit had features similar to a PC, including a hard drive and an ethernet port for online play through its service, Xbox Live. The popularity of the first-person shooter game <em class="emphasis">Halo</em>, an Xbox exclusive release, boosted sales as well. Nintendo’s GameCube did not offer DVD playback capabilities, choosing instead to focus on gaming functions. Both of these consoles sold millions of units but did not come close to the sales of the PS2.</p>

The release of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 led this generation of consoles in 2005. The Xbox 360 featured expanded media capabilities and integrated access to Xbox Live, an online gaming service. Sony’s PlayStation 3 (PS3) was released in 2006. It also featured enhanced online access as well as expanded multimedia functions, with the additional capacity to play Blu-ray discs. Nintendo released the Wii at the same time. This console featured a motion-sensitive controller that departed from previous controllers and focused on accessible, often family-oriented games. This combination successfully brought in large numbers of new game players, including many older adults.

                    <li>Video games reached wider audiences in the 1990s with the advent of the first-person shooter genre and popular non-action games such as <em class="emphasis">Myst</em>. The games were marketed to older audiences, and their success increased demand for similar games.</li>

Are video games entertainment or art? Should they focus on fostering real-life skills or developing virtual realities? Certain games have come to prominence in recent years for their innovations and genre-expanding attributes. These games are notable for not only great economic success and popularity but also for having a visible influence on culture.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s02_s01_p01">The musical series <em class="emphasis">Guitar Hero</em>, based on a Japanese arcade game of the late 1990s, was first launched in North America in 2005. In the game, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to match the rhythms and notes of famous rock songs. The closer the player approximates the song, the better the score. This game introduced a new genre of games in which players simulate playing musical instruments. <em class="emphasis">Rock Band</em>, released in 2007, uses a similar format, including a microphone for singing, a drum set, and rhythm and bass guitars. These games are based on a similar premise as earlier rhythm-based games such as <em class="emphasis">Dance Dance Revolution</em>, in which players keep the rhythm on a dance pad. <em class="emphasis">Dance Dance Revolution</em>, which was introduced to North American audiences in 1999, was successful but not to the extent that the later band-oriented games were. In 2008, music-based games brought in an estimated $1.9 billion.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_p01">The first game in the <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto (GTA)</em> series was released in 1997 for the PC and Sony PlayStation. The game had players stealing cars—not surprising given its title—and committing a variety of crimes to achieve specific goals. The game’s extreme violence made it popular with players of the late 1990s, but its true draw was the variety of options that players could employ in the game. Specific narratives and goals could be pursued, but if players wanted to drive around and explore the city, they could do that as well. A large variety of cars, from sports cars to tractor trailers, were available depending on the player’s goals. The violence could likewise be taken to any extreme the player wished, including stealing cars, killing pedestrians, and engaging the police in a shoot-out. This type of game is known as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sandbox game</a><span class="glossdef">A video game in which the player chooses among a number of different objectives.</span></span>, or open world, and it is defined by the ability of users to freely pursue their own objectives.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_039">Ryan Donald, review of Grand Theft Auto (PlayStation), <em class="emphasis">CNET</em>, 28 April 2000, <a class="link" href="http://reviews.cnet.com/legacy-game-platforms/grand-theft-auto-playstation/4505-9882_7-30971409-2.html">http://reviews.cnet.com/legacy-game-platforms/grand-theft-auto-playstation/4505-9882_7-30971409-2.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s02_s02_p02">The <em class="emphasis">GTA</em> series has evolved over the past decade by increasing the realism, options, and explicit content of the first game. <em class="emphasis">GTA III</em> and <em class="emphasis">GTA IV</em>, as well as a number of spin-off games, such as the recent addition <em class="emphasis">The Ballad of Gay Tony</em>, have made the franchise more profitable and more controversial. These newer games have expanded on the idea of an open video game world, allowing players to have their characters buy and manage businesses, play unrelated mini-games (such as bowling and darts), and listen to a wide variety of in-game music, talk shows, and even television programs. However, increasing freedom also results in increasing controversy, as players can choose to solicit prostitutes, visit strip clubs, perform murder sprees, and assault law enforcement agents. Lawsuits have attempted to tie the games to real-life instances of violence, and <em class="emphasis">GTA</em> games are routinely the target of political investigations into video game violence. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_040">Tatiana Morales, “Grand Theft Auto Under Fire,” <em class="emphasis">CBS News</em>, July 14, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/07/13/earlyshow/living/parenting/main708794.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/07/13/earlyshow/living/parenting/main708794.shtml</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p01"><em class="emphasis">World of Warcraft (WoW)</em>, released in 2004, is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) loosely based on the <em class="emphasis">Warcraft</em> strategy franchise of the 1990s. The game is conducted entirely online, though it is accessed through purchased software, and players purchase playing time. Each player chooses an avatar, or character, that belongs to one of several races, such as orcs, elves, and humans. These characters can spend their time on the game by completing quests, learning trades, or simply interacting with other characters. As characters gain experience, they obtain skills and earn virtual money. Players also choose whether they can attack other players without prior agreement by choosing a PvP (player versus player) <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">server</a><span class="glossdef">A computer in a network that provides a service to other computers linked to it.</span></span>.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p02">Various organizations have sprung up within the <em class="emphasis">WoW</em> universe. Guilds are groups that ascribe to specific codes of conduct and work together to complete tasks that cannot be accomplished by a lone individual. The guilds are organized by the players; they are not maintained by <em class="emphasis">WoW</em> developers. Each has its own unique identity and social rules, much like a college fraternity or social club. Voice communication technology allows players to speak to each other as they complete missions and increases the social bonding that holds such organizations together.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_041">Carson Barker, “Team Players: Guilds Take the Lonesome Gamer Out of Seclusion … Kind Of,” <em class="emphasis">Austin Chronicle</em>, July 28, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A390551">http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A390551</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p03"><em class="emphasis">WoW</em> has taken the medium of video games to unprecedented levels. Although series such as <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto</em> allow players a great deal of freedom, everything done in the games was accounted for at some point. <em class="emphasis">WoW</em>, which depends on the actions of millions of players to drive the game, allows people to literally live their lives through a game. In the game, players can earn virtual gold by mining it, killing enemies, and killing other players. It takes a great deal of time to accumulate gold in this manner, so many wealthy players choose to buy this gold with actual dollars. This is technically against the rules of the game, but these rules are unenforceable. Entire real-world industries have developed from this trade in gold. Chinese companies employ workers, or “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gold farmers</a><span class="glossdef">Players in <em class="emphasis">World of Warcraft</em> who work to get virtual gold so that they can sell it for actual money.</span></span>,” who work 10-hour shifts finding gold in <em class="emphasis">WoW</em> so that the company can sell it to clients. Other players make money by finding deals on virtual goods and then selling them for a profit. One <em class="emphasis">WoW</em> player even “traveled” to Asian servers to take advantage of cheap prices, conducting a virtual import–export business.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_042">Rowenna Davis, “Welcome to the New Gold Mines,” <em class="emphasis">Guardian</em> (London), March 5, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/mar/05/virtual-world-china?intcmp=239">http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2009/mar/05/virtual-world-china?intcmp=239</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s02_s03_p04">The unlimited possibilities in such a game expand the idea of what a game is. It is obvious that an individual who buys a video game, takes it home, and plays it during his or her leisure is, in fact, playing a game. But if that person is a “gold farmer” doing repetitious tasks in a virtual world to make a real-world living, the situation is not as clear. <em class="emphasis">WoW</em> challenges conventional notions of what a game is by allowing the players to create their own goals. To some players, the goal may be to gain a high level for their character; others may be interested in role-playing, whereas others are focused on making a profit. This kind of flexibility leads to the development of scenarios never before encountered in game-play, such as the development of economic classes.</p>

This effect is clearly visible in the increasing mainstream acceptance of aspects of gaming culture. Video games have also changed the way that many other forms of media, from music to film, are produced and consumed. Education has also been changed by video games through the use of new technologies that help teachers and students communicate in new ways through educational games such as <em class="emphasis">Brain Age</em>. As video games have an increasing influence on our culture, many have voiced their opinions on whether this form of media should be considered an art.</p>

Video games, like books or movies, have avid users who have made this form of media central to their lives. In the early 1970s, programmers got together in groups to play <em class="emphasis">Spacewar!</em>, spending a great deal of time competing in a game that was rudimentary compared to modern games.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_049">Stewart Brand, “Space War,” <em class="emphasis">Rolling Stone</em>, December 7, 1972.</span> As video arcades and home video game consoles gained in popularity, youth culture quickly adapted to this type of media, engaging in competitions to gain high scores and spending hours at the arcade or with the home console.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p02">In the 1980s, an increasing number of kids were spending time on consoles playing games and, more importantly, increasingly identifying with the characters and products associated with the games. Saturday morning cartoons were made out of the <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> and <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Bros.</em> games, and an array of nongame merchandise was sold with video game logos and characters. The public recognition of some of these characters has made them into cultural icons.

            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p04">The acceptance of video games in mainstream culture has consequently changed the way that the culture views certain people. “Geek” was the name given to people who were adept at technology but lacking in the skills that tended to make one popular, like fashion sense or athletic ability. Many of these people, because they often did not fare well in society, favored imaginary worlds such as those found in the fantasy and science fiction genres. Video games were appealing because they were both a fantasy world and a means to excel at something. Jim Rossignol, in his 2008 book <em class="emphasis">This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities</em>, explained part of the lure of playing <em class="emphasis">Quake III</em> online:</p>
            <span class="blockquote">

I wasn’t going to be able to indulge in the camaraderie that sports teams felt or in the extended buzz of victory through dedication and cooperation. That entire swathe of experience had been cut off from me by cruel circumstance and a good dose of self-defeating apathy. Now, however, there was a possibility for some kind of redemption: a sport for the quick-fingered and the computer-bound; a space of possibility in which I could mold friends and strangers into a proficient gaming team.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_053">Jim Rossignol, <em class="emphasis">This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities</em> (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2008), 17.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p06">Video games gave a group of excluded people a way to gain proficiency in the social realm. As video games became more of a mainstream phenomenon and video game skills began to be desired by a large number of people, the popular idea of geeks changed. It is now common to see the term “geek” used to mean a person who understands computers and technology. This former slur is also prominent in the media, with headlines in 2010 such as “Geeks in Vogue: Top Ten Cinematic Nerds.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_054">Craig Sharp, “Geeks in Vogue: Top Ten Cinematic Nerds,” <em class="emphasis">Film Shaft</em>, April 26, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.filmshaft.com/geeks-in-vogue-top-ten-cinematic-nerds/">http://www.filmshaft.com/geeks-in-vogue-top-ten-cinematic-nerds/</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p07">Many media stories focusing on geeks examine the ways in which this subculture has been accepted by the mainstream. Geeks may have become “cooler,” but mainstream culture has also become “geekier.” The acceptance of geek culture has led to acceptance of geek aesthetics. The mainstreaming of video games has led to acceptance of fantasy or virtual worlds. This is evident in the popularity of film/book series such as The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Comic book characters, emblems of geek culture, have become the vehicles for blockbuster movies such as <em class="emphasis">Spider-Man</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Dark Knight</em>. The idea of a fantasy or virtual world has come to appeal to greater numbers of people. Virtual worlds such as those represented in the <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em class="emphasis">Halo</em> series and online games such as <em class="emphasis">World of Warcraft</em> have expanded the idea of virtual worlds so that they are not mere means of escape but new ways to interact.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_055">Lars Konzack, “Geek Culture: The 3rd Counter-Culture,” (paper, FNG2006, Preston, England, June 26–28, 2006), <a class="link" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/270364/Geek-Culture-The-3rd-CounterCulture">http://www.scribd.com/doc/270364/Geek-Culture-The-3rd-CounterCulture</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p01">Video games during the 1970s and 1980s were often <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">derivatives</a><span class="glossdef">Media that uses the narratives and aesthetics of other forms of media.</span></span> of other forms of media. <em class="emphasis">E.T.</em>, <em class="emphasis">Star Wars</em>, and a number of other games took their cues from movies, television shows, and books.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p01">Television programs based on video games were an early phenomenon. <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em>, <em class="emphasis">Pole Position</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Q*bert</em> were among the animated programs that aired in the early 1980s. In the later 1980s, shows such as <em class="emphasis">The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Legend of Zelda</em> promoted Nintendo games. In the 1990s, <em class="emphasis">Pokémon</em>, originally a game developed for the Nintendo Game Boy, was turned into a television series, a card game, several movies, and even a musical.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_056">Internet Move Database, “Pokémon,” <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/">http://www.imdb.com/</a>.</span> Recently, several programs have been developed that revolve entirely around video games—the web series <em class="emphasis">The Guild</em>, for instance, tells the story of a group of friends who interact through an unspecified MMORPG.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p02">Nielsen, the company that tabulates television ratings, has begun rating video games in a similar fashion.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p03">Video games have also influenced the way that television is produced. The Rocket Racing League, scheduled to be launched in 2011, will feature a “virtual racetrack.” Racing jets will travel along a virtual track that can only be seen by pilots and spectators with enabled equipment. Applications for mobile devices are being developed that will allow spectators to race virtual jets alongside the ones flying in real time.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_058">Adam Hadhazy, “’NASCAR of the Skies’ to Feature Video Game-Like Interactivity,” <em class="emphasis">TechNewsDaily</em>, April 26, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/nascar-of-the-skies-to-feature-video-game-like-interactivity%E2%80%930475/">http://www.technewsdaily.com/nascar-of-the-skies-to-feature-video-game-like-interactivity–0475/</a>.</span> This type of innovation is only possible with a public that has come to demand and rely on the kind of interactivity that video games provide.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p01">The rise in film adaptations of video games accompanies the increased age of video game users.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p02">Another aspect of video games’ influence on films is how video game releases are marketed and perceived. The release date for anticipated game <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto IV</em> was announced and marketed to compete with the release of the film <em class="emphasis">Iron Man</em>. <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto IV</em> supposedly beat <em class="emphasis">Iron Man</em> by $300,000,000 million in sales. This kind of comparison is, in some ways, misleading. Video games cost much more than a ticket to a movie, so higher sales does not mean that more people bought the game than the movie. Also, the distribution apparatus for the two media is totally different. Movies can only be released in theaters, whereas video games can be sold at any retail outlet.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_061">Associated Press, “‘Grand Theft Auto IV’ Beats ‘Iron Man’ by $300 Million,” <em class="emphasis">Fox News</em>, May 9, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354711,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354711,00.html</a>.</span> What this kind of news story proves, however, is that the general public considers video games as something akin to a film. It is also important to realize that the scale of production and profit for video games is similar to that of films. Video games include music scores, actors, and directors in addition to the game designers, and the budgets for major games reflect this. <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto IV</em> cost an estimated $100 million to produce.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_062">Gillian Bowditch, “Grand Theft Auto Producer is Godfather of Gaming,” <em class="emphasis">Times</em> (London), April 27, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3821838.ece">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3821838.ece</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p01">Video games have been accompanied by music ever since the days of the arcade. Video game music was originally limited to computer beeps turned into theme songs. The design of the Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and Sony PlayStation made it possible to use sampled audio on new games, meaning songs played on physical instruments could be recorded and used on video games. Beginning with the music of the <em class="emphasis">Final Fantasy</em> series, scored by famed composer Nobuo Uematsu, video game music took on film score quality, complete with full orchestral and vocal tracks. This innovation proved beneficial to the music industry. Well-known musicians such as Trent Reznor, Thomas Dolby, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani were able to create the soundtracks for popular games, giving these artists exposure to new generations of potential fans.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_063">“Video Games Music Big Hit,” <em class="emphasis">Wilmington (NC) Morning Star</em>, February 1, 1997, 36.</span> Composing music for video games has turned into a profitable means of employment for many musicians.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p02">Many rock bands have allowed their previously recorded songs to be used in video games, similar to a hit song being used on a movie soundtrack. The bands are paid for the rights to use the song, and their music is exposed to an audience that otherwise might not hear it. As mentioned earlier, games like <em class="emphasis">Rock Band</em> and <em class="emphasis">Guitar Hero</em> have been used to promote bands. The release of <em class="emphasis">The Beatles: Rock Band</em> was timed to coincide with the release of digitally remastered reissues of the Beatles’ albums.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p03">Another phenomenon relating to music and video games involves musicians covering video game music. A number of bands perform only video game covers in a variety of styles, such as the popular Japanese group the Black Mages, which performs rock versions of <em class="emphasis">Final Fantasy</em> music. Playing video game themes is not limited to rock bands, however. An orchestra and chorus called Video Games Live started a tour in 2005 dedicated to playing well-known video game music.

Participants in the test were asked to play a first-person shooter game for one hour a day for 10 days, and were then tested for specific visual attention skills. The playing improved these skills in all participants, but the regular video game players had a greater skill level than the non–game players. According to the study, “Although video-game playing may seem to be rather mindless, it is capable of radically altering visual attention processing.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_068">C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p02">Other educational institutions have begun to embrace video games as well.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Video Games as Art</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s04_p01">While universally accepted as a form of media, a debate has recently arisen over whether video games can be considered a form of art. Roger Ebert, the well-known film critic, has historically argued that “video games can never be art,” citing the fact that video games are meant to be won, whereas art is meant to be experienced.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_072">Roger Ebert, “Video Games Can Never Be Art,” <em class="emphasis">Chicago Sun-Times</em>, April 16, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html">http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s04_p02">His remarks have generated an outcry from both video gamers and developers. Many point to games such as 2009’s <em class="emphasis">Flower</em>, in which players control the flow of flower petals in the wind, as examples of video games developing into art. <em class="emphasis">Flower</em> avoids specific plot and characters to allow the player to focus on interaction with the landscape and the emotion of the game-play.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_073">That Game Company, “Flower,” <a class="link" href="http://thatgamecompany.com/games/flower/">http://thatgamecompany.com/games/flower/</a>.</span> Likewise, more mainstream games such as the popular Katamari series, released in 2004, are built around the idea of creation, requiring players to pull together a massive clump of objects in order to create a star.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s04_p03">Video games, once viewed as a mindless source of entertainment, are now being featured in publications such as <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em> magazine and <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_074">Max Fisher, “Are Video Games Art?” <em class="emphasis">Atlantic Wire</em>, April 19, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Are-Video-Games-Art-1085/">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Are-Video-Games-Art-1085/</a>.</span> With the development of increasingly complex musical scores and the advent of machinima, the boundaries between video games and other forms of media are slowly blurring. While they may not be considered art by everyone, video games have contributed significantly to modern artistic culture.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_p01">The increasing realism and expanded possibilities of video games has inspired a great deal of controversy. However, even early games, though rudimentary and seemingly laughable nowadays, raised controversy over their depiction of adult themes. Although increased realism and graphics capabilities of contemporary video games have increased the shock value of in-game violence, international culture has been struggling to come to terms with video game violence since the dawn of video games.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Violence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s01_p01">Violence in video games has been controversial from their earliest days. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"><em class="emphasis">Death Race</em></a><span class="glossdef">A 1978 arcade game that drew protest over its depiction of violence.</span></span>, an arcade game released in 1976, encouraged drivers to run over stick figures, which then turned into <em class="emphasis">X</em>s. Although the programmers claimed that the stick figures were not human, the game was controversial, making national news on the television talk show <em class="emphasis">Donahue</em> and the television news magazine <em class="emphasis">60 Minutes</em>. Video games, regardless of their realism or lack thereof, had added a new potential to the world of games and entertainment: the ability to simulate murder.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s01_p02">The enhanced realism of video games in the 1990s accompanied a rise in violent games as companies expanded the market to target older demographics. A great deal of controversy exists over the influence of this kind of violence on children, and also over the rating system that is applied to video games. There are many stories of real-life violent acts involving video games. The 1999 <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Columbine High School massacre</a><span class="glossdef">The 1999 high school shooting that many people connected with the first-person shooter genre of video games.</span></span> was quickly linked to the teenage perpetrators’ enthusiasm for video games. The families of Columbine victims brought a lawsuit against 25 video game companies, claiming that if the games had not existed, the massacre would not have happened.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_075">Mark Ward, “Columbine Families Sue Computer Game Makers,” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, May 1, 2001, <a class="link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1295920.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1295920.stm</a>.</span> In 2008, a 17-year-old boy shot his parents after they took away his video game system, killing his mother.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_076">Mike Harvey, “Teenager Daniel Petric Shot Parents Who Took Away Xbox,” <em class="emphasis">Times</em> (London), January 13, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5512446.ece">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5512446.ece</a>.</span> Also in 2008, when 6 teens were arrested for attempted carjacking and robbery, they stated that they were reenacting scenes from <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_077">Lee Cochran, “Teens Say: Video Game Made Them Do It,” <em class="emphasis">ABC News</em>, June 27, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5262689">http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=5262689</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s01_p03">There is no shortage of news stories that involve young men commiting crimes relating to an obsession with video games. The controversy has not been resolved regarding the influences behind these crimes. Many studies have linked aggression to video games; however, critics take issue with using the results of these studies to claim that the video games caused the aggression. They point out that people who enact video-game–related crimes already have psychopathic tendencies, and that the results of such research studies are correlational rather than causational—a naturally violent person is drawn to play violent video games.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_078">Jill U. Adams, “A Closer Look: Effects of Violent Video Games,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, May 3, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/health/la-he-closer-20100503,0,5586471.story">http://www.latimes.com/news/health/la-he-closer-20100503,0,5586471.story</a>.</span> Other critics point out that violent games are designed for adults, just as violent movies are, and that parents should enforce stricter standards for their children.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s01_p04">The problem of children’s access to violent games is a large and complex one. Video games present difficult issues for those who create the ratings. One problem is the inconsistency that seems to exist in rating video games and movies. Movies with violence or sexual themes are rated either R or NC-17. Filmmakers prefer the R rating over the NC-17 rating because NC-17 ratings hurt box office sales, and they will often heavily edit films to remove overly graphic content. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB)</a><span class="glossdef">The organization that creates ratings for video games.</span></span>, rates video games. The two most restrictive ratings the ESRB has put forth are “M” (for Mature; 17 and older; “may contain mature sexual themes, more intense violence, and/or strong language”) and “AO” (for Adults Only; 18 and up; “may include graphic depictions of sex and/or violence”). If this rating system were applied to movies, a great deal of movies now rated R would be labeled AO. An AO label can have a devastating effect on game sales; in fact, many retail outlets will not sell games with an AO rating.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_079">Paul Hyman, “Video Game Rating Board Don’t Get No Respect,” <em class="emphasis">Hollywood Reporter</em>, April 8, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000874859">http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000874859</a>.</span> This creates a situation where a video game with a sexual or violent scene as graphic as the ones seen in R-rated movies is difficult to purchase, whereas a pornographic magazine can be bought at many convenience stores. This issue reveals a unique aspect of video games. Although many of them are designed for adults, the distribution system and culture surrounding video games is still largely youth-oriented.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Video Game Addiction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s02_p01">Another controversial issue is the problem of video game addiction. As of the print date, the American Medical Association (AMA) has not created an official diagnosis of video game addiction, citing the lack of long-term research. However, the AMA uses the term “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">video game overuse</a><span class="glossdef">The term used in lieu of “video game addiction” by the American Medical Association while further research is conducted to determine the correct classification.</span></span>” to describe video game use that begins to affect other aspects of an individual’s life, such as relationships and health. Studies have found that socially marginalized people have more of a tendency to overuse games, especially online role-playing games like <em class="emphasis">World of Warcraft</em>. Other studies have found that patterns of time usage and social dysfunction in players who overuse games are similar to those of other addictive disorders.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_080">Mohamed Khan, <em class="emphasis">Emotional and Behavioral Effects of Video Games and Internet Overuse</em>, American Medical Association, Council on Science and Public Health, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/443/csaph12a07-fulltext.pdf">http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/443/csaph12a07-fulltext.pdf</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s02_p02">Groups such as Online Gamers Anonymous have developed a 12-step program similar to that of Alcoholics Anonymous to help gamers deal with problems relating to game overuse. This group is run by former online gamers and family members of those affected by heavy game use.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_081">On-line Gamers Anonymous, “About OLGA &amp; OLG-Anon,” <a class="link" href="http://www.olganon.org">http://www.olganon.org</a>.</span> This problem is not new, but it has become more prevalent. In the early 1990s, many stories surfaced of individuals dropping out of college or getting divorced because of addiction to MUDs.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_082">R. W. Greene, “Is Internet Addiction for Worrywarts or a Genuine Problem?” <em class="emphasis">CNN</em>, September 23, 1998, <a class="link" href="http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9809/23/netaddict.idg/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/TECH/computing/9809/23/netaddict.idg/index.html</a>.</span> In addition, heavy video gaming, much like heavy computer use in an office setting, can result in painful repetitive stress injuries. Even worse are the rare, but serious, cases of death resulting from video game overuse. In the early 1980s, two deaths were linked to the video game <em class="emphasis">Berzerk</em>. The players, both in their late teens, suffered fatal heart attacks while struggling to achieve top scores.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_083">Arcade History, “Berzerk, the Video Game,” <a class="link" href="http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=berzerk&amp;page=detail&amp;id=236">http://www.arcade-history.com/?n=berzerk&amp;page=detail&amp;id=236</a>.</span> The issue of video game addiction has become a larger one because of the ubiquity of video games and Internet technology. In countries that have a heavily wired infrastructure, such as South Korea, the problem is even bigger. In 2010, excessive game use was problematic enough that the South Korean government imposed an online gaming curfew for people under the age of 18 that would block certain sites after midnight. This decision followed the death of a 3-month-old baby from starvation while her parents played an online game at an Internet café.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_084">Geoffrey Cain, “South Korea Cracks Down on Gaming Addiction,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, April 20, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1983234,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1983234,00.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s02_p03">Another side of video game addiction is told well by Jim Rossignol in his book <em class="emphasis">This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities</em>. The book describes Rossignol’s job as a journalist for a financial company and his increasing involvement with <em class="emphasis">Quake III</em>. Rossignol trained a team of players to compete in virtual online tournaments, scheduling practices and spending the hours afterward analyzing strategies with his teammates. His intense involvement in the game led to poor performance at his job, and he was eventually fired. After being fired, he spent even more time on the game, not caring about his lack of a job or shrinking savings. The story up to this point sounds like a testimonial about the dangers of game addiction. However, because of his expertise in the game, he was hired by a games magazine and enjoyed full-time employment writing about what he loved doing. Rossignol does not gloss over the fact that games can have a negative influence, but his book speaks to the ways in which gaming—often what would be described as obsessive gaming—can cause positive change in people’s lives.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_085">Jim Rossignol, <em class="emphasis">This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities</em> (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2008), 4–11.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p02">Male influence can be seen throughout the industry. Women make up less than 12 percent of game designers and programmers, and those who do enter the field often find themselves facing subtle—and not so subtle—sexism.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_087">Media Awareness Network, “Gender Stereotyping,” <a class="link" href="http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/video_games/concerns/gender_videogames.cfm">http://www.media-awareness.ca/english/parents/video_games/concerns/gender_videogames.cfm</a>.</span> When <em class="emphasis">Game Developer</em> magazine released its list of top 50 people in the video game industry for 2010, bloggers were quick to note that no female developers appeared in the list.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_088">Cory Doctorow, “Gamasutra’s Most Important Gamers List Is a Boy’s Club,” <em class="emphasis">BoingBoing</em> (blog), April 14, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://boingboing.net/2010/04/14/gamasutras-most-impo.html">http://boingboing.net/2010/04/14/gamasutras-most-impo.html</a>.</span> In 2007, scandal erupted over a pornographic comic featuring Jade Raymond, current managing director of the French video game publisher Ubisoft, that surfaced on an online forum. The motivation behind the comic was to allege that Raymond did not deserve her position at Ubisoft because she earned it based on her looks, rather than on her abilities and experience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p03">Sexism in video games has existed since the early days of the medium. The plot of the infamous <em class="emphasis">Custer’s Revenge</em>, released for the Atari 2600 in 1982, centered on the rape of a Native American woman. Popular NES games such as <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Bros.</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Legend of Zelda</em> featured a male figure rescuing a damsel in distress. Both the protagonist and antagonist in the original <em class="emphasis">Tomb Raider</em> game had hourglass figures with prominent busts and nonexistent waists, a trend that continues in the franchise today. In 2003, the fighting series <em class="emphasis">Dead or Alive</em> released a spin-off game titled <em class="emphasis">Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball</em> that existed to showcase the well-endowed female characters in swim attire.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_089">Michael Strauss, “A Look at Female Characters in Video Games,” Associated Content, July 16, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/5487226/a_look_at_female_characters_in_video_pg2.html?cat=19">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/5487226/a_look_at_female_characters_in_video_pg2.html?cat=19</a>.</span> The spin-off was so popular that two more similar games were released.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p04">Some note that video games are not unique in their demeaning portrayal of women. Like movies, television, and other media forms, video games often fall back on gender stereotyping in order to engage consumers. Defenders point out that many male video game characters are also depicted lewdly. Games such as <em class="emphasis">God of War</em> and <em class="emphasis">Mortal Kombat</em> feature hypersexualized men with bulging muscles and aggressive personalities who rely on their brawn rather than their brains. How are men affected by these stereotypes? Laboratory studies have shown that violence and aggression in video games affect men more than women, leading to higher levels of male aggression.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_090">Bruce D. Bartholow and Craig A. Anderson, “Effects of Violent Video Games on Aggressive Behavior: Potential Sex Differences,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Experimental Social Psychology</em> 38, no. 3 (2002): 283–290.</span> While sexism is certainly present in video games, it seems sexual stereotyping affects both genders negatively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s04_s03_p05">In recent years, game designers have sought to move away from these clichéd representations of gender. The popular game <em class="emphasis">Portal</em>, released in 2007, features a female protagonist clad in a simple orange jumpsuit who relies on her wits to solve logic puzzles. Series such as <em class="emphasis">Half-Life</em> and <em class="emphasis">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney</em> star male heroes who are intellectuals instead of warriors. Other games, like the <em class="emphasis">Mass Effect</em> series and <em class="emphasis">Halo: Reach</em>, allow gamers to choose the gender of the main character without altering elements of the plot or game-play. However, despite recent strides forward, there is no doubt that as the video game industry continues to evolve, so too will the issue of gender.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s05_p01">Early video games were easily identifiable as games. They had basic goals and set rules of play. As games have developed in complexity, they have allowed for newer options and an expanded idea of what constitutes a game. At the same time, the aesthetics and design of game culture have been applied to tools and entertainment phenomena that are not technically games. The result is a blurring of the lines between games and other forms of communication, and the creation of new means of mixing information, entertainment, and communication.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Video Games and the Social World of Sports</h2>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s05_s01_p01">Video games have developed in complexity and flexibility to the point that they are providing new kinds of social interactions. This is perhaps clearest when games are compared to physical sports. Most of the abstract reasons for involvement in sports—things like teamwork, problem solving, and leadership—are also reasons to play video games that allow online team interaction. Sports are often portrayed as a social platform where people can learn new skills. Amateur sports teams provide an important means of socialization and communication for many people, allowing individuals from different gender, ethnic, and class backgrounds to find a common forum for communication. Video games have similar capacities; players who engage in online team battles must communicate with one another effectively and learn to collectively solve problems. In fact, video games could arguably provide a more inclusive platform for socializing because they do not exclude most socially or physically challenged individuals. The social platform of online games is certainly no utopia, as competitive endeavors of any sort inevitably create opportunities for negative communication, but it allows people of different genders, races, and nationalities to play on equal footing, a feat that is difficult, if not impossible, in the physical realm.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s05_s02_p03">MMORPGs can function as a kind of hybrid of social media and video games in this respect. In some instances, these games could function entirely as social media, and not as games. Consider a player who has no desire to achieve any of the prescribed goals of a game, such as going on quests or accomplishing tasks. This individual could simply walk around in social areas and talk to new people. Is the player still playing a game at this point, or has the game turned into a type of social media?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s05_s02_p09">Virtual worlds are societies in which communication can be expanded to relay information in ways that cannot be done with other forms of media.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s05_s05_p01">An important genre of games is often overlooked when focusing on the overall history and effect of video games. These games are created to get a specific point across to the player, and are generally low-budget efforts by individuals or small groups. The group Molleindustria puts out a host of these games, including <em class="emphasis">Oligarchy</em>, a game in which the player is an oil-drilling business executive who pursues corruption to gain profits, or <em class="emphasis">Faith Fighter</em>, in which religious icons fight each other.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_099">Molle Industria, <a class="link" href="http://www.molleindustria.org/en/home">http://www.molleindustria.org/en/home</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">Downing Street Fighter</em> is a similar game, designed as a satirical representation of the United Kingdom’s 2010 elections.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_100">Zain Verjee, “Will There Be a Knockout Blow?” <em class="emphasis">CNN</em>, May 3, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://ukelection.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/03/will-there-be-a-knock-out-blow/">http://ukelection.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/03/will-there-be-a-knock-out-blow/</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s05_s05_p02">Other games in this genre include a great deal of content that informs players about current events. One example is <em class="emphasis">Cutthroat Capitalism</em>, where users play the part of Somali pirates who are carrying out kidnapping and piracy missions. The player must weigh the risks and rewards of their exploits given a variety of economic factors.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_101">Scott Carney, “An Economic Analysis of the Somali Pirate Business Model,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, July 13, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-07/ff_somali_pirates">http://www.wired.com/politics/security/magazine/17-07/ff_somali_pirates</a>.</span> This game allows players to understand the forces at work behind international phenomena such as piracy.

Political satire in the medium of the video game allows the player to, in effect, play a satirical joke to its logical conclusion, exploring the entire scope of the joke. Advocacy games engage players with an interactive political message, rather than sending out traditional media ads. Mainstream groups such as PETA have also turned to video games to convey messages.
