    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_p01">In Gutenberg’s age and the subsequent modern era, literacy—the ability to read and write—was a concern not only of educators but also of politicians, social reformers, and philosophers. A literate population, many reasoned, would be able to seek out information, stay informed about the news of the day, communicate with others, and make informed decisions in many spheres of life. Because of this, the reasoning went, literate people made better citizens, parents, and workers. In the 20th century, as literacy rates grew around the globe, there was a new sense that merely being able to read and write was not enough. In a world dominated by media, individuals needed to be able to understand, sort through and analyze the information they were bombarded with every day. In the second half of the 20th century, a name was finally put to this skill of being able to decode and process the messages and symbols transmitted via media: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">media literacy</a><span class="glossdef">The skill of being able to decode and process the messages and symbols transmitted via media.</span></span>. According to the nonprofit National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE), a person who is media literate is able to access, analyze, evaluate, and communicate information. Put another way by John Culkin, a pioneering advocate for media literacy education, “the new mass media—film, radio, TV—are new languages, their grammar as yet unknown.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_033">Kate Moody, “John Culkin, SJ: The Man Who Invented Media Literacy: 1928–1993,” Center for Media Literacy, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.medialit.org/reading_room/article408.html">http://www.medialit.org/reading_room/article408.html</a> (accessed July 15, 2010).</span> Media literacy seeks to give media consumers the ability to understand this new language.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Be Media Literate?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_p01">Culkin called the pervasiveness of media “the unnoticed fact of our present,” noting that media information was as omnipresent and easy to overlook as the air we breathe (and, he noted, “some would add that it is just as polluted”). Our exposure to media starts early—a study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 68 percent of children aged two and younger spend an average of two hours in front of a screen (either computer or television) each day, while children under six spend as much time in front of a screen as they do playing outside. As previously noted, U.S. teenagers are spending an average of 7.5 hours with media daily, nearly as long as they spend in school. Media literacy isn’t merely a skill for young people, however. Today, Americans of all ages get much of their information from various media sources. One crucial role of media literacy education is to enable all of us to skeptically examine the often-conflicting media messages we receive every day.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Advertising</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s01_p01">Many of the hours people spend with media are with commercial-sponsored content. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) estimated that children aged 2 to 11 saw, on average, 25,629 television commercials a year, or more than 10,700 minutes of ads. Adults saw 52,469 ads, or about 15.5 days worth of television advertising.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_034">Debra Holt, Pauline Ippolito, Debra Desrochers, and Christopher Kelley, “Children’s Exposure to TV Advertising in 1977 and 2004,” Federal Trade Commission Bureau of Economics Staff Report, June 1, 2007.</span> Children (and adults) are bombarded with contradictory messages—newspaper articles about the obesity epidemic are side by side with ads touting soda, candy, and fast food. The American Academy of Pediatrics maintains that advertising directed at children under eight is “inherently deceptive” and exploitative because young children cannot tell the difference between programs and commercials.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_035">Donald Shifrin, “Perspectives on Marketing, Self-Regulation and Childhood Obesity,” Remarks given at Federal Trade Commission Workshop July 14–15, 2005, Washington, DC.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s01_p02">Advertising raises other issues as well. It often uses techniques of psychological pressure to influence decision making. Ads might appeal to vanity, insecurity, prejudice, fear, or the desire for adventure. This is not always a negative thing—antismoking public service announcements may rely on disgusting images of blackened lungs to shock viewers. Nonetheless, media literacy attempts to teach people to be informed and guarded consumers, and to evaluate claims with a critical eye. Do “four out of five doctors” really endorse the product?</p>

        <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Bias, Spin, and Misinformation</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s02_p01">Advertisements may have the explicit goal of selling a product or idea, but they’re not the only kind of media message with an agenda. A politician may hope to persuade potential voters that she has their best interests at heart. An ostensibly objective journalist may allow his or her own political leanings to subtly slant articles. Magazine writers might avoid criticizing companies that advertise heavily in their pages. Broadcast news reporters may sensationalize stories in order to boost ratings—and advertising rates.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s02_p02">An important part of media literacy is remembering that mass communication messages are created by individuals, each with a set of values, assumptions, and priorities. Accepting media messages at face value could lead to head-spinning confusion, thanks to all the contradictory information that’s out there. For example, in 2010, a highly contested governor’s race in New Mexico led to conflicting ads from both candidates, Diane Denish and Susana Martinez. Each claimed that the other agreed to policies that benefited sex offenders. According to the media watchdog site <a class="link" target="_blank" href="Factcheck.org">Factcheck.org</a>, the Denish team’s ad “shows a pre-teen girl—seemingly about 9 years old—going down a playground slide in slow-motion, while ominous music plays in the background and an announcer discusses two sex crime cases. It ends with an empty swing, as the announcer says: ‘Today we don’t know where these sex offenders are lurking, because Susana Martinez didn’t do her job.’” The opposing ad proclaims that “a department in Denish’s cabinet gave sanctuary to criminal illegals [<em class="emphasis">sic</em>], like child molester Juan Gonzalez.” Both claims are highly inflammatory, play on fear, and distort the reality behind each situation. Media literacy attempts to give people the skills to look critically at these and other media messages—to sift through various claims, and to make sense of the often-conflicting information we face every day.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">New Skills for a New World</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s03_p01">In the past, one goal of education was to provide students with the information deemed necessary to successfully engage with the world. Students memorized multiplication tables, state capitals, famous poems, and notable dates. In today’s world, however, vast amounts of information are available at the click of a mouse. Even before the advent of the Internet, noted communications scholar David Berlo foresaw the consequences of expanding information technology: “Most of what we have called formal education has been intended to imprint on the human mind all of the information that we might need for a lifetime.” Changes in technology necessitate changes in how we learn, Berlo noted, and these days “education needs to be geared toward the handling of data rather than the accumulation of data.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_037">David Shaw, “A Plea for Media Literacy in our Nation’s Schools,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, November 30, 2003.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s01_s03_p02">Online technology surely has changed how we learn. For example, Wikipedia, a hugely popular Internet encyclopedia, is at the center of a debate on the proper use of online sources. In 2007, Middlebury College banned the use of Wikipedia as a source in history papers and exams. One of the school’s librarians noted that the online encyclopedia “symbolizes the best and worst of the Internet. It’s the best because everyone gets his/her say and can state their views. It’s the worst because people who use it uncritically take for truth what is only opinion.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_038">Meredith Byers, “Controversy over use of Wikipedia in academic papers arrives at Smith,” <em class="emphasis">Smith College Sophian</em>, News section, March 8, 2007.</span> Or as comedian and satirist Stephen Colbert put it, “any user can change any entry, and if enough other users agree with them, it becomes true.” In 2007, CIA computers were used to make edits on the site’s article about the President of Iran. The Vatican allegedly doctored the entry for Irish activist and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams. A computer registered to the U.S. Democratic Party changed the site’s page for Rush Limbaugh to proclaim that he was “racist” and a “bigot.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_039">Jonathan Fildes, “Wikipedia ‘shows CIA page edits.’” <em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, Science and Technology section, August 15, 2007.</span> Media literacy teaches today’s students how to sort through the Internet’s cloud of data, ferret out reliable sources, and be aware of bias and unreliable sources.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Individual Accountability and Popular Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_p01">Ultimately, media literacy teaches that messages and images are constructed with various aims in mind and that each individual has the responsibility to evaluate and interpret these media messages. Mass communication may be created and disseminated by individuals, businesses, governments, or organizations, but they are always received by an individual, even if that individual is sitting in a crowded theater. Education, life experience, and a host of other factors allow each person to interpret constructed media in different ways; there is no “right answer,” or one way to read the media. But media literacy skills help us to function better in our media-rich environment, enabling us to be better democratic citizens, smarter shoppers, and more skeptical media consumers. As a means to this end, NAMLE has come up with a list of five questions to ask when analyzing media messages:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_l01">

            <li>How might different people understand this message differently?</li>
            <li>What values, lifestyles, and points of view are represented in, or omitted from, this message?</li>
            <li>Why is this message being sent?<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_040">Center for Media Literacy, MediaLitKit, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.medialit.org/pdf/mlk/14A_CCKQposter.pdf">http://www.medialit.org/pdf/mlk/14A_CCKQposter.pdf</a> (accessed July 15, 2010).</span>

                <li>Media literacy, or the ability to decode and process media messages, is especially key in today’s media-saturated society.

Advertisements, bias, spin, and misinformation are all things to look out for.</li>
                <li>Individual responsibility is crucial for media literacy because, while media messages may be produced by individuals, companies, governments, or organizations, they are always received and decoded by individuals.</li>

            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s07_s02_p04">In a heavily mediated world, almost every organization, from a university to a multinational corporation, employs media specialists. Many organizations also use consultants to help analyze and manage the interaction between their organizations and the media. Independent consultants develop projects, keep abreast of media trends, and provide advice based on industry reports. Or, as writer, speaker, and media consultant Merlin Mann puts it, the “primary job is to stay curious about everything, identify the points where two forces might clash, then enthusiastically share what that might mean, as well as why you might care.”</p>
