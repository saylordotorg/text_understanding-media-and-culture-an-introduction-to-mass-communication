    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_p01">In the mid-1990s, CD sales were booming. Cassette tapes were all but obsolete, and record companies were reaping the benefits of sales to consumers who wanted their music collections in the latest technological format. This boom was a familiar step in the evolution of technology. In past decades, records seemed to have an ironclad lock on sales, but they were eventually passed by cassette sales. Cassettes, as previously mentioned, were then passed by CD sales. However, despite a few advantages in quality and convenience, there were several areas in which CDs were lacking. They were expensive for consumers to purchase, and consumers had to buy a full album even if they were only interested in listening to one or two songs on it because every album came as a complete package.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_p02">At the height of the CD revolution, new digital technology was being developed that would eliminate these disadvantages and revolutionize digital music storage. In 1989, German company Fraunhofer-Gesellshaft discovered how to compress digital audio to approximately one-tenth the size of the original audio with almost no discernable loss in quality to the average listener. Small enough to be transmitted over a modem, the so-called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">MP3 files</a><span class="glossdef">Compressed digital audio files that are small enough to transfer over the Internet while maintaining high audio quality.</span></span> (the <em class="emphasis">MP</em> stands for <em class="emphasis">Moving Pictures Experts Group</em>, which is the group that sets the standard for audio and video compression and transmission, and the <em class="emphasis">3</em> refers to the most popular layer or scheme with the standard) could be downloaded onto a website or FTP site in a relatively short amount of time. Initially done only by a tech-savvy elite, the process of downloading and sharing audio files was a painstaking process because MP3 files were not in one centralized location. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Peer-to-peer</a><span class="glossdef">A communications model in which participants access shared files on each other’s computers via the Internet.</span></span> file sharing—the process in which two or more computer systems are connected over the Internet for the purpose of sharing music or video files—became a worldwide phenomenon in 1999 with the development of centralized online file-sharing system Napster.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p01">In 1999, Northeastern University student Shawn Fanning dropped out of school to complete work on a software project that would simplify finding and downloading MP3 files on the Internet.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_069">T. C. Doyle, “Shawn Fanning, Founder, Napster,” <em class="emphasis">CRN</em>, November 10, 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18834885/shawn-fanning-founder-napster.htm;jsessionid=nqMTTQpakxKozxhpf778kw**.ecappj01">http://www.crn.com/news/channel-programs/18834885/shawn-fanning-founder-napster.htm;jsessionid=nqMTTQpakxKozxhpf778kw**.ecappj01</a>.</span> The result was a free downloadable <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Napster</a><span class="glossdef">A centralized online file-sharing system that enabled users to download and share free music. Napster was closed down for copyright infringement in 2000 and relaunched 3 years later as a subscription service.</span></span> program that transformed PCs into servers for exchanging music files over the Internet. The program also sported a chat-room feature that served a community of music fans eager to discuss their favorite bands. Originally an experiment between Fanning and his friends, the program’s popularity spread through word of mouth. By the end of the first week, 15,000 people had downloaded the program.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_070">Sarah Riedel, “A Brief History of Filesharing: From Napster to Legal Music Downloads,” Associated Content from Yahoo, February 24, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/20644/a_brief_history_of_filesharing_from_pg2.html?cat=15">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/20644/a_brief_history_of_filesharing_from_pg2.html?cat=15</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p02">Although music fans were thrilled by their newfound ability to download free songs (albeit illegally), the record industry was not happy. In December 1999, all four major record labels, together with the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), launched a series of lawsuits against Fanning and his site for copyright infringement. Citing the nonpayment of royalties and the loss of revenue through lost CD sales, the RIAA also claimed that artists would be unwilling to create new songs now that they could be obtained for free. In response, Napster argued that it merely provided the software for people to share music files and no copyrighted material appeared on the site itself. In addition, Fanning claimed that the site encouraged people to go out and buy CDs based on the exposure artists received from Napster.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_072">Sarah Riedel, “A Brief History of Filesharing: From Napster to Legal Music Downloads,” Associated Content from Yahoo, February 24, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/20644/a_brief_history_of_filesharing_from_pg2.html?cat=15">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/20644/a_brief_history_of_filesharing_from_pg2.html?cat=15</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p03">As the number of the Napster program users grew, the lawsuit began to garner publicity. Some Napster supporters, many of them college students, viewed the legal battle as a David versus Goliath situation and rooted for Fanning to beat the corporate music giants. Most recording artists sided with the record labels, with heavy metal rock group Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre launching their own separate lawsuits against Napster in April 2000. However, some bands discovered a way to use the site to their advantage. Alternative rock group Radiohead promoted its album <em class="emphasis">Kid A</em> by secretly releasing the record to Napster 3 weeks before its street release date, creating a wave of publicity that launched the album to the No. 1 spot on the <em class="emphasis">Billboard 200</em> chart in October 2000.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_073">Richard Menta, “Did Napster Take Radiohead’s New Album to Number 1?” <a class="link" href="http://MP3newswire.net">MP3newswire.net</a>, October 28, 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2000/radiohead.html">http://www.mp3newswire.net/stories/2000/radiohead.html</a>.</span> Reggae-rock band Dispatch poured free recordings onto the site, increasing its fan base to such an extent that it sold out multiple nights at Madison Square Garden in early 2007.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_074">Steve Knopper, “Napster Wounds the Giant,” <em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em>, January 2, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/02/napster-wounds-the-giant/">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/02/napster-wounds-the-giant/</a>.</span> Dispatch bassist Pete Heimbold said, “[w]hat we found was it really didn’t deter kids from coming to shows and buying CDs. In fact, I think it had the opposite effect—people heard songs off Napster and had a lot of merchandise and CDs.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_075">Steve Knopper, “Napster Wounds the Giant,” <em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em>, January 2, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/02/napster-wounds-the-giant/">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/02/napster-wounds-the-giant/</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p04">Despite the Napster program’s many advantages, including a built-in user base of 26.4 million people, the major record labels were unable to reach a deal with the site to create any form of fee-based service. In 2007, former EMI Executive Ted Cohen said, “[t]he record labels had an opportunity to create a digital ecosystem and infrastructure to sell music online, but they kept looking at the small picture instead of the big one. They wouldn’t let go of CDs.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_076">Seth Mnookin, “Universal’s CEO Once Called iPod Users Thieves. Now He’s Giving Songs Away,’ <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, November 27, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/15-12/mf_morris?currentPage=2">http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/15-12/mf_morris?currentPage=2</a>.</span> A court injunction in 2000 ordered Napster to remove all copyrighted material from its servers, and within two days the website was effectively shut down. Following a bankruptcy liquidation, the Napster program was reinvented as a paid subscription service in 2003. Under its new terms, users pay a fee to access music.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Post-Napster Universe: Gnutella and Kazaa</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s01_p01">Napster’s initial success resulted in a wave of similar sites emerging throughout 2000. The creators of these new services recognized that Napster’s legal problems were the result of maintaining a central file server. By keeping a list of all the users on the network, Napster was able to control its users’ activities by blocking illegal downloads. When the court ordered the service to halt illegal downloading, the absence of a central database destroyed the entire Napster network.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s01_p02">To avoid a similar fate, new peer-to-peer (P2P) systems adopted two different approaches. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Gnutella network</a><span class="glossdef">A peer-to-peer system without a centralized database. The Gnutella network includes clients such as LimeWire, BearShare, and WinMX. Because it does not have a central network, the Gnutella network would be difficult to close down.</span></span>, which serves clients such as LimeWire, BearShare, and WinMX, avoided maintaining a central database. Instead, it dispersed information about file locations across computer “nodes” around the world. Users were able to find each other, but the service could disclaim the ability to prevent copyright infringements. The lack of a centralized server and multiple client base meant that, unlike Napster, it would be impossible to shut down the entire Gnutella network through a simple court order. Courts would need to block all Gnutella network traffic at the Internet service provider (ISP) level of the Internet, a far trickier prospect than simply shuting down a central database.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s01_p03">In addition to a lack of a central database, some P2P providers set up in offshore locations to take advantage of less-restrictive copyright laws and weaker enforcement. Kazaa was initially based in the Pacific island nation of Vanuata and operated out of Australia. However, the company’s offshore location did not protect it from copyright infringement laws. After a series of legal wrangles, Kazaa was ordered to modify its software in Australia in 2005 and agreed to pay $100 million in damages to the record industry. In 2006, the site became a legal music download service.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_077"><em class="emphasis">BBC News</em>, “Kazaa Site Becomes Legal Service,” July 27, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5220406.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5220406.stm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s01_p04">Not content with pursuing providers of illegal music downloads, the RIAA also took legal action against the users of sites such as LimeWire and Kazaa. In 2003, the recording industry sued 261 American music fans for illegally sharing songs on P2P networks.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_078">David Kravets, “File Sharing Lawsuits at a Crossroads, After 5 Years of RIAA Litigation,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, September 4, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/">http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2008/09/proving-file-sh/</a>.</span> Athough fines under U.S. copyright law can rise to up to $150,000 per illegally downloaded track, most of the cases were settled for much less.

The verdict was thrown out a year later when a federal judge declared a mistrial. However, jurors in Thomas’s second trial found her guilty again, upping the fine to $1.92 million. A federal judge later reduced the damages to $50,000.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s02_p01">With the closure of the Napster program and the crackdown on illegal downloading, a void in the music distribution market opened and was almost immediately filled by fee-based online music providers. This void helped to resurrect one company many feared was declining. Apple launched the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">iTunes appliance program</a><span class="glossdef">A free computer application, first lauched for the Mac computer in 2001 and later expanded to include PCs, that converts audio CDs into digital music files, organizes digital music collections, and plays Internet radio.</span></span>—a free application for the Mac computer that converted audio CDs into digital music files, organized digital music collections, and played Internet radio—and the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">iPod</a><span class="glossdef">A portable MP3 player, launched by Apple in 2001, that is compatible with iTunes software.

In 2003, the company signed deals with all of the major record labels and launched the iTunes Store, a virtual store that enabled people to buy and download digital music on demand. Initially featuring 200,000 songs at a cost of $0.99 each to download, the store quickly revolutionized the digital music industry. Within a week, iTunes Store customers purchased 1 million songs.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_085">Apple, “iPod + iTunes Timeline,” Apple Press Info, <a class="link" href="http://www.apple.com/pr/products/ipodhistory/">http://www.apple.com/pr/products/ipodhistory/</a>.</span> Six months later, Apple convinced the record labels to expand the service to Microsoft Windows operating system users, and by the following year, the iTunes Store had gone international. Within 5 years of its launch, the iTunes Store was the top music seller in the United States, and in February 2010, Apple celebrated its 10 billionth download.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_086">Martyn Williams, “Timeline: iTunes Store at 10 Billion,” <em class="emphasis">Computerworld</em>, February 24, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9162018/Timeline_iTunes_Store_at_10_billion">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9162018/Timeline_iTunes_Store_at_10_billion</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s03_p01">Once digital music technology was introduced to the world, its domination of the music industry was almost instantaneous. MP3 players have several key advantages over CD players. They are smaller and more portable, eliminating the necessity of lugging around bulky CD carrying cases. Whereas CDs can only hold a relatively small amount of data, MP3 players are able to compress thousands of songs onto a single device (this lack of packaging and manufacturing has caused disputes between artists and labels over royalties, which will be discussed later on). The lack of moving parts means MP3 players can be taken jogging or cycling without the risk of a song skipping every time the user hits a bumpy patch of road. Users are also no longer obligated to buy entire albums; instead, they can pick and choose their favorite songs from a catalog of online music.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s03_p02">Of the many brands of MP3 player currently available on the market, Apple’s iPod has been the dominant force in the digital music industry since its launch in 2001 (see <a class="xref" href="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s02#lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_s02_f02" xrefstyle="select: label">Figure 6.15</a>). Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs attributed the success of his product to its simple design. In a 2005 interview he said, “One of the biggest insights we have was that we decided not to try to manage your music library on the iPod, but to manage it in iTunes. Other companies tried to do everything on the device itself and made it so complicated that it was useless.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_090">Steven Levy, “Q&amp;A: Jobs on iPod’s Cultural Impact,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, October 15, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15262121/site/newsweek/print/1/displaymode/1098/</a>.</span> The iPod has also reaped the benefits of a successful marketing campaign and constant reinvention of its original format. Customers now have the choice of several different iPod models according to their need for storage space and desire for additional services such as Internet access and video-playing capability.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s03_s01_p01">One effect that Apple iTunes and other online retailers have had on the music industry is to shake up the way that profits are divided among artists and record labels. Because of the unanticipated boom in digital record sales, recording artists and their publishers were unprepared for the possibility that they might need to renegotiate their contracts to include digital downloads. Many artists discovered to their cost that their contracts predated the digital download era, leaving them open to exploitative royalty rates for digital downloads of songs and ringtones.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s03_s01_p02">The very definition of digital royalties is still under negotiation—should a download be classified as licensed use of an artist’s music (which nets the artist approximately 50 percent of the download fee in royalties), or should it be classified as a retail sale (which nets the artist approximately 12 percent of the download fee in royalties)?<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_092">Sean Michaels, “Eminem Sues Universal Over Digital Royalties,” <em class="emphasis">Guardian</em> (London), February 25, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/25/eminem-universal-digital-royalties-lawsuit">http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/25/eminem-universal-digital-royalties-lawsuit</a>.</span> The answer depends on the contractual agreement between artists and record labels. In 2009, rapper Eminem’s publishing company FBT Productions sued Universal Music Group for $1.6 million of unpaid royalties, arguing that the downloads should fall under the “licensing” agreements that cover physical releases such as CDs, rather than the “distribution” agreements put forth by Universal Music Group.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_093">Sean Michaels, “Eminem Sues Universal Over Digital Royalties,” <em class="emphasis">Guardian</em> (London), February 25, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/25/eminem-universal-digital-royalties-lawsuit">http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/25/eminem-universal-digital-royalties-lawsuit</a>.</span> A jury agreed that a song sold online is no different from a song bought in a store and ruled in favor of the record label.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s03_s01_p03">Because online retailers such as Apple are responsible for the marketing, management, and delivery of downloaded music, record labels’ overheads are much lower. This new industry trend has prompted many artists and publishers to demand a bigger share of labels’ profits. As of 2010, a $0.99 download from the iTunes appliance program generates $0.30 for Apple and $0.70 for the record label, of which $0.09 goes to the songwriter and publisher as a standard mechanical royalty.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_094">Chloe Albanesius, “Music-Download Royalty Rates Left Unchanged,” <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>, October 2, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2331598,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2331598,00.asp</a>.</span></p>

Although many people have switched from illegally downloading to purchasing music on digital stores, paid digital downloads have not yet begun to make up for the loss of revenue from CD sales, and illegal downloads remain a problem for the recording industry.

Former head of Yahoo! Music David Goldberg said, “The digital music business is a war of attrition that nobody seems to be winning. The CD is still disappearing, and nothing is replacing it in entirety as a revenue generator.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_096">David Goldman, “Music’s Lost Decade: Sales Cut in Half,” <em class="emphasis">CNN</em>, February 3, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/02/news/companies/napster_music_industry/index.htm">http://money.cnn.com/2010/02/02/news/companies/napster_music_industry/index.htm</a>.</span> In 2009, digital revenue sales rose and were well on the way to equaling CD sales, which were on the decline.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s04_p01">Over the past few years, the Internet has begun to level the proverbial playing field between major and independent record labels. Exemplifying how smaller indie labels are able to latch on to trends more quickly than the Big Four, indies have embraced new technology, including blogging, online video sites, and online social networking sites, as a means of promoting their music, while the major labels have fallen behind the curve. With social networking sites enabling artists to communicate directly with their fans, the need for extensive financial backing or an industry middleman is all but eliminated. Now, artists can upload their music onto a social networking site for free and generate record sales purely through word of mouth.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s04_p02">Although a few indie artists have become household names entirely through the buzz generated on social networking sites, many others find that they need some guidance. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">direct-to-fan</a><span class="glossdef">Business model used by independent artists and labels to market and distribute their music directly to fans, bypassing major record labels. New Internet technology has made it possible for artists to use the direct-to-fan model successfully. It has been embraced by high-profile bands such as Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails.</span></span> business model has created opportunities for web-based companies such as Nimbit and ReverbNation, which provide software that enables independent artists and record labels to market their music online, keep track of sales, create demand for their music, and communicate with fans. The companies offer social networking applications that enable fans to purchase music directly from the artists rather than being redirected to a third-party website. Other advantages for bands include automatic updates to fans across a variety of networking sites, digital distribution through the iTunes appliance program and other stores, and real-time sales updates.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s04_p03">Many established artists have also embraced the direct-to-fan business model. In 2007, Nine Inch Nails frontman Trent Reznor announced that the band was splitting from its contractual obligations to Universal Music Group to distribute its next albums independently. Well known for his vocal distaste of major record labels and their profiteering, Reznor encouraged fans in Australia to steal his album <em class="emphasis">Year Zero</em> because he believed it was priced too highly there.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_100">“Trent Reznor Blasts Label,” <em class="emphasis">SPIN</em>, May 15, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.spin.com/articles/trent-reznor-blasts-label">http://www.spin.com/articles/trent-reznor-blasts-label</a>.</span> Commenting on the state of the music industry in a 2007 interview he said, “I’ve got a battle where I’m trying to put out quality material that matters and I’ve got fans that feel it’s their right to steal it and I’ve got a company that’s so bureaucratic and clumsy and ignorant and behind the times they don’t know what to do, so they rip the people off.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_101">Neala Johnson, “Q &amp; A with Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails,” <em class="emphasis">Herald Sun</em> (Melbourne), May 17, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/q-a-with-trent-reznor-of-nine-inch-nails/story-e6frf9hf-1111113550202">http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/music/q-a-with-trent-reznor-of-nine-inch-nails/story-e6frf9hf-1111113550202</a>.</span> Following the band’s split with Universal, they released studio album <em class="emphasis">The Slip</em> as a free digital download in 2008. Reznor stated, “[t]his one’s on me,” on his website, thanking fans for their loyalty. The album was downloaded 1.4 million times within the first 6 weeks of its release.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn06_102">F.

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_s04_l01" mark="bullet">
                    <li>The introduction of digital music technology and peer-to-peer file sharing in 1999 changed the nature of the music industry. Websites, such as the Napster service, which enabled users to share free music, negatively impacted CD sales. Although the RIAA successfully shut down Napster, other sites emerged throughout the early 2000s, such as the Gnutella network and the Kazaa service. Rather than figuring out a way to make money from digital music, the recording industry focused its efforts on bringing lawsuits against illegal downloaders. By the time iTunes and other fee-based music sites became available, irreversible damage had been done to the industry’s sales figures.</li>
                    <li>Apple’s iTunes Store is the dominant digital music retailer in the United States, commanding almost 70 percent of the digital music market. The boom in digital music sales has affected the music industry in several ways: It has changed the way that profits are distributed among recording artists and labels, it has caused a massive decline in CD sales, and it has prompted industry executives to seek profits elsewhere (for example, through licensing fees).</li>
                    <li>The Internet has proved advantageous for smaller indie labels that take advantage of blogging, social networking sites, and video websites as a means to promote their music. Companies such as Nimbit and ReverbNation are replacing some of the functions performed by major record labels, enabling artists to promote and distribute their own music directly to fans. Established bands such as Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails have separated from major labels and used the Internet to successfully distribute their music at little or no cost to fans. The ready availability and low cost of this new technology is changing the music industry, and the Big Four companies may need to adapt traditional business models to return to profit.</li>
