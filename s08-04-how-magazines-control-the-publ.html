            <li>Describe how the formats of newspapers and magazines differ.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_p01">Magazines control the public’s access to information in a variety of ways. Like the newspaper industry, the magazine industry dictates not only which stories get told but also how those stories are presented. Although significant similarities between the newspaper and magazine industries’ control over information exist, some notable differences within the industries themselves deserve exploration.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Format</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p01">In general, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">format</a><span class="glossdef">The physical appearance and specifications of a magazine.</span></span> of most magazines allows for a more in-depth discussion of a topic than is possible in the relatively constrained space available in newspapers. Most large newspapers, such as <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em> or the <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, generally cap even their longest articles at 1,000 words.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_065">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Newspapers” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&amp;media=2">http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&amp;media=2</a>.</span> Magazines, however, frequently allow for double that word count when publishing articles of great interest.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_066">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Magazines” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_magazines_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&amp;media=7">http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_magazines_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&amp;media=7</a>.</span> Length, however, varies from magazine to magazine and story to story. Coverage of the war in Iraq offers a good example of this variance. Researchers studied magazine coverage of Iraq over a period of 4 weeks in 2003 by examining the difference in reporting among <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, and <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p02">In these four issues, the war in Iraq accounted for more than a fifth (22 percent) of all stories and roughly a third (32 percent) of all the space. These stories were also more likely than others to be long and in depth…. There were also differences in the way that the three magazines covered the situation. <em class="emphasis">Time</em> devoted the most space to the war, 37 percent, compared to the 34 percent for <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> and 24 percent for <em class="emphasis">U.S. News</em>. And again, <em class="emphasis">Time</em> had more long stories (seven stories in the four issues studied were more than 2,000 words). <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> ran six long stories in the four issues studied and <em class="emphasis">U.S. News</em> ran two long stories.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_067">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Magazines” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_magazines_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&amp;media=7">http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_magazines_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&amp;media=7</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p03">Although these differences might not appear that great, the results reflect editorial choice and, therefore, the power the magazine industry has over information control.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s02" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Choice to Publish</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p01">Just as newspapers do, magazines control which stories reach the public by deciding which articles to include in their publications. As might be expected, the choice of stories depends on the political climate and on global events.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s02_p02">Leading newsmagazines <em class="emphasis">Time</em> and <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> both underwent major transitions in their content during the late 20th century. Between the 1970s and 1990s, both greatly increased science articles, entertainment articles, and stories on personal health. Interestingly, despite both publications’ stated commitment to news, a dramatic decrease took place in articles on domestic- and foreign-government affairs. Whether these changes reflected a change in reader interest or an alteration in the editors’ perspectives remains unclear; however, these shifts demonstrate that what is published is entirely up to the magazine and its editorial staff, as they are the ones who have the final word.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advertisers’ Influence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p01">Magazines derive approximately half of their income from advertisers.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_068">“Magazines: Economics and Careers,” March 20, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm">http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm</a>.</span> With such a large stake in the magazine industry, advertisers can play a major role in deciding which stories are printed. Because magazines are so dependent on advertisers for their revenue, they are cautious about the content they place in their pages.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p02">Magazines tend to shy away from controversial content that can turn off advertisers. Recently, a large American auto manufacturer sent a memo to about 50 magazines asking that their ad agency be notified if future issues of the magazine contained articles that addressed political, sexual, or social issues that might be seen as provocative, controversial, or offensive.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_069">“Magazines: Economics and Careers,” March 20, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm">http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p03">The balance that magazines must maintain to keep advertisers happy is a delicate one. With ad prices driving the magazine industry, many publications are forced to satisfy advertisers by avoiding potentially controversial stories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p04">Another anecdote about advertisers controlling stories illustrates how some publishers must conform to advertiser demands.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p05">In an even more blatant attempt to influence magazine content, another large corporation informed a number of magazine publishers that the content of their magazines would be carefully monitored for several months and that a large advertising contract would be awarded to the publication that portrayed their industry in the most favorable light.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_070">“Magazines: Economics and Careers,” March 20, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm">http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p06">With stories such as these, it may seem easy to paint the advertising industry as an evil, controlling entity that seeks to keep stories from the public. While advertisers may exhibit some control over stories, they also have a lot at stake.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p07">As online media grows, today many advertisers are pulling their expensive print ads in favor of cheaper, web-based advertisements.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_071">David Knarr, “Magazine Advertising – Trade Secrets,” <a class="link" href="http://www.studio1productions.com/Articles/MagAds.htm">http://www.studio1productions.com/Articles/MagAds.htm</a>.</span> Advertising revenue has decreased steadily since the 1990s, mirroring the rise in online readership.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_072">“Periodicals: Publishing, or Publishing and Printing” <a class="link" href="http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/wood/periodicals-publishing-publishing-printing">http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/wood/periodicals-publishing-publishing-printing</a>.</span> This drop in advertising may, in fact, force magazines to give advertisers more control over their content to avoid losing further funding. While it may be difficult to precisely pin down the level of influence advertisers exert over magazine content, evidence suggests they do exert some control.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Editorial Leanings</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s04_p01">Each magazine has its own editorial slant, which helps determine which stories get published and how those stories are presented. A 2003 study examining leading newsmagazines <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, and <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> verified these differences by demonstrating variations in how the publications presented their articles to the reading public.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s04_p02"><em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> … is the most information-laden, the most likely to publish highly traditional hard news topics and the most likely to report in a neutral manner—a more straightforward accounting of the facts of events with less of a writer’s “take” or opinion on what those events mean. <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> is lighter, more oriented toward lifestyle and celebrity coverage, and more likely to publish stories that contain an emotional component. <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine is something of a hybrid between the two. Its content is more like <em class="emphasis">U.S. News</em>’—neutral and information driven. Its covers, on the other hand, look a good deal more like <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>’s—highlighting lifestyle and entertainment.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_073">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Magazines” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s04_p03">These distinctions among the three publications may seem slight, but they have an effect on the information contained between their covers. However, these editorial leanings do not make one magazine more prestigious or valid than the others; <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> may offer facts and figures about a particular event, while <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> may provide the human side of the story. Readers should understand, though, that several variables affect the articles that they see in each publication.</p>

    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s05" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Online News Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s05_p01">The Internet has significantly changed the way that the public receives information. The advent of online news sources has somewhat lessened the control that magazines have over information. Today, several online-only magazines provide, for little to no cost, news and coverage that would have previously been available only through print publications. Online-only magazines include <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, which offers a daily digest of information from newspapers around the globe, and <em class="emphasis">Salon</em>, which provides readers many stories for free and more in-depth coverage for a subscription cost. Like their print counterparts, online magazines rely on revenue from advertisers, but because that advertising is less costly, advertisers may have less of a stake in online content. All these factors contribute to changing perspectives on the way that information is being controlled in the journalism industry.</p>
