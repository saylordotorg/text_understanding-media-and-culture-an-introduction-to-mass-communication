    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_p01">Since 1896, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> has printed the phrase “All the News That’s Fit to Print” as its masthead motto. The phrase itself seems innocent enough, and it has been published for such a long time now that many probably skim over it without giving it a second thought. Yet, the phrase represents an interesting phenomenon in the newspaper industry: control. Papers have long been criticized for the way stories are presented, yet newspapers continue to print—and readers continue to buy them.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">“All the News That’s Fit to Print”</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p01">In 1997, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> publicly claimed that it was “an independent newspaper, entirely fearless, free of ulterior influence and unselfishly devoted to the public welfare.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_045">Edward S. Herman, “All the News Fit to Print: Structure and Background of the New York Times,” <em class="emphasis">Z Magazine</em>, April 1998, <a class="link" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Herman%20/AllNewsFit_Herman.html">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Herman%20/AllNewsFit_Herman.html</a>.</span> Despite this public proclamation of objectivity, the paper’s publishers have been criticized for choosing which articles to print based on personal financial gain. In reaction to that statement, scholar Edward S. Herman wrote that the issue is that <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> “defin[es] public welfare in a manner acceptable to their elite audience and advertisers.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_046">Edward S. Herman, “All the News Fit to Print: Structure and Background of the New York Times,” <em class="emphasis">Z Magazine</em>, April 1998, <a class="link" href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Herman%20/AllNewsFit_Herman.html">http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Herman%20/AllNewsFit_Herman.html</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> has continually been accused of determining what stories are told. For example, during the 1993 debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> clearly supported the agreement. In doing so, the newspaper exercised editorial control over its publication and the information that went out to readers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p02">However, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> is not the only newspaper to face accusations of controlling which stories are told. In his review of <em class="emphasis">Read All About It: The Corporate Takeover of America’s Newspapers</em>, Steve Hoenisch, editor of <a class="link" href="http://Criticism.com"><em class="emphasis">Criticism.com</em></a>, offers these harsh words about what drives the stories printed in today’s newspaper:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p03">I’ve always thought of daily newspapers as the guardians of our—meaning the public’s—right to know. The guardians of truth, justice, and public welfare and all that. But who am I fooling? America’s daily newspapers don’t belong to us. Nor, for that matter, do they even seek to serve us any longer. They have more important concerns now: appeasing advertisers and enriching stockholders.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_047">Steven Hoenisch, “Corporate Journalism,” review of <em class="emphasis">Read All About It: The Corporate Takeover of America’s Newspapers</em>, by James D. Squires, <a class="link" href="http://www.criticism.com/md/crit1.html#section-Read-All-About-It">http://www.criticism.com/md/crit1.html#section-Read-All-About-It</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p04">More and more, as readership declines, newspapers must answer to advertisers and shareholders as they choose which stories to report on.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p05">However, editorial control does not end there. Journalists determine not only what stories are told but also how those stories are presented. This issue is perhaps even more delicate than that of selection. Most newspaper readers still expect news to be reported objectively and demand that journalists present their stories in this manner. However, careful public scrutiny can burden journalists, while accusations of controlling information affect their affiliated newspapers. However, this scrutiny takes on importance as the public turns to journalists and newspapers to learn about the world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p06">Journalists are also expected to hold themselves to high standards of truth and originality. Fabrication and plagiarism are prohibited. If a journalist is caught using these tactics, then his or her career is likely to end for betraying the public’s trust and for damaging the publication’s reputation. For example, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> reporter Jayson Blair lost his job in 2003 when his plagiary and fabrication were discovered, and <em class="emphasis">The New Republic</em> journalist Stephen Glass was fired in 1998 for inventing stories, quotes, and sources.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p07">Despite the critiques of the newspaper industry and its control over information, the majority of newspapers and journalists take their roles seriously. Editors work with journalists to verify sources and to double-check facts so readers are provided accurate information. In this way, the control that journalists and newspapers exert serves to benefit their readers, who can then be assured that articles printed are correct.</p>

<em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> Revisits Old Stories</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p08">Despite the criticism of <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, the famous newspaper has been known to revisit their old stories to provide a new, more balanced view. One such example occurred in 2004 when, in response to criticism on their handling of the Iraq War, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> offered a statement of apology. The apology read as follows:</p>
            <span class="blockquote">
                <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p09">We have found a number of instances of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been. In some cases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged. Looking back, we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims as new evidence emerged—or failed to emerge.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_048">Editorial, “The Times and Iraq,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, May 26, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/international/middleeast/26FTE_NOTE.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/international/middleeast/26FTE_NOTE.html</a>.</span></p>
            </span>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s01_p10">Although the apology was risky—it essentially admitted guilt in controlling a controversial story—<em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> demonstrated a commitment to ethical journalism.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Watchdog Journalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p01">One way that journalists control stories for the benefit of the public is by engaging in <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">watchdog journalism</a><span class="glossdef">Independent scrutiny by the press of the activities of government, business, and other public institutions to document, question, and investigate those activities to provide the public and officials with timely information on issues of public concern.</span></span>. This form of journalism provides the public with information about government officials or business owners while holding those officials to high standards of operation. Watchdog journalism is defined as “(1) independent scrutiny by the press of the activities of government, business and other public institutions, with an aim toward (2) documenting, questioning, and investigating those activities, to (3) provide publics and officials with timely information on issues of public concern.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_049">W. Lance Bennett and William Serrin, “The Watchdog Role,” in <em class="emphasis">The Institutions of American Democracy: The Press</em>, ed. Geneva Overholser and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 169.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p03">One of the most famous examples of watchdog journalism is the role that Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein of <em class="emphasis">The Washington Post</em> played in uncovering information about the Watergate break-in and scandal that ultimately resulted in President Richard Nixon’s resignation. Newspapers and journalists often laud watchdog journalism, one of the most important functions of newspapers, yet it is difficult to practice because it requires rigorous investigation, which in turn demands more time. Many journalists often try to keep up with news as it breaks, so journalists are not afforded the time to research the information—nor to hone the skills—required to write a watchdog story. “Surviving in the newsroom—doing watchdog stories—takes a great deal of personal and political skill. Reporters must have a sense of guerilla warfare tactics to do well in the newsroom.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_050">W. Lance Bennett and William Serrin, “The Watchdog Role,” in <em class="emphasis">The Institutions of American Democracy: The Press</em>, ed. Geneva Overholser and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 182.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s02_p04">To be successful, watchdog journalists must investigate stories, ask tough questions, and face the possibility of unpopularity to alert the public to corruption or mismanagement while elevating the public’s expectations of the government. At the same time, readers can support newspapers that employ this style of journalism to encourage the press to engage in the challenging watchdog form of journalism. As scholars have observed, “not surprisingly, watchdog journalism functions best when reporters understand it and news organizations and their audiences support it.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_051">W. Lance Bennett and William Serrin, “The Watchdog Role,” in <em class="emphasis">The Institutions of American Democracy: The Press</em>, ed. Geneva Overholser and Kathleen Hall Jamieson (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 185.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Impact of Television and the Internet on Print</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_p01">Newspapers have control over which stories are told and how those stories are presented. Just as the newspaper industry has changed dramatically over the years, journalistic writing styles have been transformed. Many times, such changes mirrored a trend shift in readership; since the 1950s, however, newspapers have had to compete with television journalism and, more recently, the Internet. Both television and the Internet have profoundly affected newspaper audiences and journalistic styles.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Case Study: <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>
</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, founded in 1982 and known for its easy-to-read stories, is but one example of a paper that has altered its style to remain competitive with television and the Internet. In the past, newspapers placed their primary focus on the written word. Although some newspapers still maintain the use of written narration, many papers have shifted their techniques to attract a more television-savvy audience. In the case of <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, the emphasis lies on the second track—the visual story—dominated by large images accompanied by short written stories. This emphasis mimics the television presentation format, allowing the paper to cater to readers with short attention spans.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p02">A perhaps unexpected shift in journalistic writing styles that derives from television is the more frequent use of present tense, rather than past tense, in articles. This shift likely comes from television journalism’s tendency to allow a story to develop as it is being told. This subtle but noticeable shift from past to present tense in narration sometimes brings a more dramatic element to news articles, which may attract readers who otherwise turn to television news programs for information.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s03_s03_s01_p03">Like many papers, <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> has redesigned its image and style to keep up with the sharp immediacy of the Internet and with the entertainment value of television. In fact, the paper’s management was so serious about their desire to compete with television that from 1988 to 1990 they mounted a syndicated television series titled <em class="emphasis">USA Today: The Television Show</em> (later retitled <em class="emphasis">USA Today on TV</em>).<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_052">“U.S.A Today: The Television Series,” Internet Movie Database, <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094572/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094572/</a>.</span> Despite its short run, the show demonstrated the paper’s focus on reaching out to a visual audience, a core value that it has maintained to this day. Today, <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> has established itself as a credible and reliable news source, despite its unorthodox approach to journalism.</p>
