            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p01">Under the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">traditional publicity model</a><span class="glossdef">A PR model that aims to gain media attention.</span></span>, PR professionals seek to create media coverage for a client, product, or event. These efforts can range from wild publicity stunts to simple news conferences to celebrity interviews in fashion magazines. P. T. Barnum was an early American practitioner of this kind of PR. His outrageous attempts at publicity worked because he was not worried about receiving negative press; instead, he believed that any coverage was a valuable asset. More recent examples of this style of extreme publicity include controversy-courting musicians such as Lady Gaga and Marilyn Manson. More restrained examples of this type of PR include the modern phenomenon of faded celebrities appearing on television shows, such as Paula Abdul’s long-running appearances on <em class="emphasis">American Idol</em>.</p>

This model is less concerned with obtaining dramatic, extensive media coverage than with disseminating information in a way that ensures adequate reception.

In addition, public interest groups release the results of research studies for use by policy makers and the public.</p>

One of the first professional PR experts, Bernays made the two-way asymmetric model his early hallmark. In a famous campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes, he convinced a group of well-known celebrities to walk in the New York Easter parade smoking Lucky Strikes.

By facilitating a back-and-forth discussion that results in mutual understanding and an agreement that respects the wishes of both parties, this PR model is often practiced in town hall meetings and other public forums in which the public has a real effect on the results. In an ideal republic, Congressional representatives strictly employ this model. Many nonprofit groups that are run by boards and have public service mandates use this model to ensure continued public support.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s01_s04_p02">Commercial ventures also rely on this model. PR can generate media attention or attract costumers, and it can also ease communication between a company and its investors, partners, and employees. The two-way symmetric model is useful in communicating within an organization because it helps employees feel they are an important part of the company. Investor relations are also often carried out under this model.</p>

First, practitoners identify and qualify the issue to be addressed. Then, they research the organization itself to clarify issues of public perception, positioning, and internal dynamics. Strategists can also research the potential audience of the campaign. This audience may include media outlets, constituents, consumers, and competitors. Finally, the context of the campaign is often researched, including the possible consequences of the campaign and the potential effects on the organization. After considering all of these factors, practitioners are better educated to select the best type of campaign.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s01_p01">During the 1930s, the De Beers company had an enormous amount of diamonds and a relatively small market of luxury buyers. They launched a PR campaign to change the image of diamonds from a luxury good into an accessible and essential aspect of American life. The campaign began by giving diamonds to famous movie stars, using their built-in publicity networks to promote De Beers. The company created stories about celebrity proposals and gifts between lovers that stressed the size of the diamonds given. These stories were then given out to selected fashion magazines. The result of this campaign was the popularization of diamonds as one of the necessary aspects of a marriage proposal.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_072">Stuart Reid, “The Diamond Myth,” <em class="emphasis">Atlantic</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/12/the-diamond-myth/5491/">http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/12/the-diamond-myth/5491/</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para">In response to the increasing number of health concerns surrounding smoking, tobacco companies began running ads that argued the benefits of smoking their brand.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s02_p01">In 1953, studies showing the detrimental health effects of smoking caused a drop in cigarette sales. An alliance of tobacco manufacturers hired the PR group Hill &amp; Knowlton to develop a campaign to deal with this problem. The first step of the campaign Hill &amp; Knowlton devised was the creation of the Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC) to promote studies that questioned the health effects of tobacco use. The TIRC ran advertisements featuring the results of these studies, giving journalists who were addressing the subject an easy source to quote. The groups working against smoking were not familiar with media relations, making it harder for journalists to quote them and use their arguments.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s02_p02">The campaign was effective, however, not because it denied the harmful effects of smoking but because it stressed the disagreements between researchers. By providing the press with information favorable to the tobacco manufacturers and publicly promoting new filtered cigarettes, the campaign aimed to replace the idea that smoking was undeniably bad with the idea that there was disagreement over the effects of smoking. This strategy served tobacco companies well up through the 1980s.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">PR as a Replacement for Advertising</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_p01">In some cases, PR has begun overtaking advertising as the preferred way of promoting a particular company or product. For example, the tobacco industry offers a good case study of the migration from advertising to PR. Regulations prohibiting radio and television cigarette advertisements had an enormous effect on sales. In response, the tobacco industry began using PR techniques to increase brand presence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_p02">Tobacco company Philip Morris started underwriting cultural institutions and causes as diverse as the Joffrey Ballet, the Smithsonian, environmental awareness, and health concerns. Marlboro sponsored events that brought a great deal of media attention to the brand. For example, during the 1980s, the Marlboro Country Music Tour took famous country stars to major coliseums throughout the country and featured talent contests that brought local bands up on stage, increasing the audience even further. Favorable reviews of the shows generated positive press for Marlboro. Later interviews with country artists and books on country music history have also mentioned this tour.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_p03">On the fifth anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1987, Marlboro’s PR groups organized a celebration hosted by comedian Bob Hope. Country music legends the Judds and Alabama headlined the show, and Marlboro paid for new names inscribed on the memorial. By attaching the Marlboro brand to such an important cultural event, the company gained an enormous amount of publicity. Just as importantly, these efforts at least partially restored the stature that the brand lost due to health concerns.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_074">Leonard Saffir, <em class="emphasis">Power Public Relations: How to Master the New PR</em> (Lincolnwood, IL: NTC Contemporary, 2000), 77–88.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_p01">While advertising is an essential aspect of initial brand creation, PR campaigns are vital to developing the more abstract aspects of a brand. These campaigns work to position a brand in the public arena in order to give it a sense of cultural importance.</p>
            <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Shift From Advertising to PR</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s01_p01">Pioneered by such companies as Procter &amp; Gamble during the 1930s, the older, advertising-centric model of branding focused on the product, using advertisements to associate a particular branded good with quality or some other positive cultural value. Yet, as consumers became exposed to ever-increasing numbers of advertisements, traditional advertising’s effectiveness dwindled. The ubiquity of modern advertising means the public is sceptical of—or even ignores—claims advertisers make about their products. This credibility gap can be overcome, however, when PR professionals using good promotional strategies step in.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s01_p02">The new PR-oriented model of branding focuses on the overall image of the company rather than on the specific merits of the product. This branding model seeks to associate a company with specific personal and cultural values that hold meaning for consumers. In the early 1990s, for example, car company Saturn marketed its automobiles not as a means of transportation but as a form of culture. PR campaigns promoted the image of the Saturn family, associating the company with powerful American values and giving Saturn owners a sense of community. Events such as the 1994 Saturn homecoming sought to encourage this sense of belonging. Some 45,000 people turned out for this event; families gave up their beach holidays simply to come to a Saturn manufacturing plant in Tennessee to socialize with other Saturn owners and tour the facility.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s01_p03">Recently Toyota faced a marketing crisis when it instituted a massive recall based on safety issues. To counter the bad press, the company launched a series of commercials featuring top Toyota executives, urging the public to keep their faith in the brand.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_075">Sharon Bernstein, “Toyota faces a massive marketing challenge,” <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, February 9, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/09/business/la-fi-toyota-marketing10-2010feb10">http://articles.latimes.com/2010/feb/09/business/la-fi-toyota-marketing10-2010feb10</a>.</span> Much like the Volkswagen ads half a century before, Toyota used a style of self-awareness to market its automobiles. The positive PR campaign presented Toyotas as cars with a high standard of excellence, backed by a company striving to meet customers’ needs.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s02_p01">Apple has also employed this type of branding with great effectiveness. By focusing on a consistent design style in which every product reinforces the Apple experience, the computer company has managed to position itself as a mark of individuality. Despite the cynical outlook of many Americans regarding commercial claims, the notion that Apple is a symbol of individualism has been adopted with very little irony. Douglas Atkin, who has written about brands as a form of cult, readily admits and embraces his own brand loyalty to Apple:</p>
                <span class="blockquote block">
                    <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s02_p02">I’m a self-confessed Apple loyalist. I go to a cafe around the corner to do some thinking and writing, away from the hurly-burly of the office, and everyone in that cafe has a Mac. We never mention the fact that we all have Macs. The other people in the cafe are writers and professors and in the media, and the feeling of cohesion and community in that cafe becomes very apparent if someone comes in with a PC. There’s almost an observable shiver of consternation in the cafe, and it must be discernable to the person with the PC, because they never come back.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s02_p03">Brand managers that once focused on the product now find themselves in the role of community leaders, responsible for the well-being of a cultural image.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_076">Douglas Atkin, interview, <em class="emphasis">Frontline</em>, <em class="emphasis">PBS</em>, February 2, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/atkin.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/atkin.html</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s02_p04">Kevin Roberts, the current CEO of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Worldwide, a branding-focused creative organization, has used the term “lovemark” as an alternative to trademark. This term encompasses brands that have created “loyalty beyond reason,” meaning that consumers feel loyal to a brand in much the same way they would toward friends or family members. Creating a sense of mystery around a brand generates an aura that bypasses the usual cynical take on commercial icons. A great deal of Apple’s success comes from the company’s mystique. Apple has successfully developed PR campaigns surrounding product releases that leak selected rumors to various press outlets but maintain secrecy over essential details, encouraging speculation by bloggers and mainstream journalists on the next product. All this combines to create a sense of mystery and an emotional anticipation for the product’s release.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s02_p05">Emotional connections are crucial to building a brand or lovemark. An early example of this kind of branding was Nike’s product endorsement deal with Michael Jordan during the 1990s. Jordan’s amazing, seemingly magical performances on the basketball court created his immense popularity, which was then further built up by a host of press outlets and fans who developed an emotional attachment to Jordan. As this connection spread throughout the country, Nike associated itself with Jordan and also with the emotional reaction he inspired in people. Essentially, the company inherited a PR machine that had been built around Jordan and that continued to function until his retirement.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_077">Kevin Roberts, interview, <em class="emphasis">Frontline</em>, <em class="emphasis">PBS</em>, December 15, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/roberts.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/roberts.html</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s03_p01">An important part of maintaining a consistent brand is preserving the emotional attachment consumers have to that brand. Just as PR campaigns build brands, PR crises can damage them. For example, the massive Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 became a PR nightmare for BP, an oil company that had been using PR to rebrand itself as an environmentally friendly energy company.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s03_p02">In 2000, BP began a campaign presenting itself as “Beyond Petroleum,” rather than British Petroleum, the company’s original name. By acquiring a major solar company, BP became the world leader in solar production and in 2005 announced it would invest $8 billion in alternative energy over the following 10 years. BP’s marketing firm developed a PR campaign that, at least on the surface, emulated the forward-looking two-way symmetric PR model. The campaign conducted interviews with consumers, giving them an opportunity to air their grievances and publicize energy policy issues. BP’s website featured a carbon footprint calculator consumers could use to calculate the size of their environmental impact.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_078">Gregory Solman, “BP: Coloring Public Opinion?” <em class="emphasis">Adweek</em>, January 14, 2008, 1<a class="link" href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/strategy/e3i9ec32f006d17a91cd72d6192b9f7599a">http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/strategy/e3i9ec32f006d17a91cd72d6192b9f7599a</a>.</span> The single explosion on BP’s deep-water oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico essentially nullified the PR work of the previous 10 years, immediately putting BP at the bottom of the list of environmentally concerned companies.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s03_p03">A company’s control over what its brand symbolizes can also lead to branding issues. The Body Shop, a cosmetics company that gained popularity during the 1980s and early 1990s, used PR to build its image as a company that created natural products and took a stand on issues of corporate ethics. The company teamed up with Greenpeace and other environmental groups to promote green issues and increase its natural image.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s04_s01_s03_p04">By the mid-1990s, however, revelations about the unethical treatment of franchise owners called this image into serious question. The Body Shop had spent a great deal of time and money creating its progressive, spontaneous image. Stories of travels to exotic locations to research and develop cosmetics were completely fabricated, as was the company’s reputation for charitable contributions. Even the origins of the company had been made up as a PR tool: the idea, name, and even product list had been ripped off from a small California chain called the Body Shop that was later given a settlement to keep quiet. The PR campaign of the Body Shop made it one of the great success stories of the early 1990s, but the unfounded nature of its PR claims undermined its image dramatically. Competitor L’Oréal eventually bought the Body Shop for a fraction of its previous value.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_079">Jon Entine, “Queen of Green Roddick’s ‘Unfair Trade’ Started When She Copied Body Shop Formula,” <em class="emphasis">Daily Mail (London)</em>, September 15, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-482012/Queen-Green-Roddicks-unfair-trade-started-copied-Body-Shop-formula.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-482012/Queen-Green-Roddicks-unfair-trade-started-copied-Body-Shop-formula.html</a>.</span></p>

By building their brands into global symbols, both companies also came to represent unfettered capitalist greed to those who opposed them. During the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle, activists targeted Starbucks and Nike stores for physical attacks such as window smashing. Labor activists have also condemned Nike over the company’s use of sweatshops to manufacture shoes. Eventually, Nike created a vice president for corporate responsibility to deal with sweatshop issues.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_080">Naomi Klein, <em class="emphasis">No Logo</em> (New York: Picador, 2002), 366.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s05_p01">Politics and PR have gone hand in hand since the dawn of political activity. Politicians communicate with their constituents and make their message known using PR strategies. Benjamin Franklin’s trip as ambassador to France during the American Revolution stands as an early example of political PR that followed the publicity model. At the time of his trip, Franklin was an international celebrity, and the fashionable society of Paris celebrated his arrival; his choice of a symbolic American-style fur cap immediately inspired a new style of women’s wigs. Franklin also took a printing press with him to produce leaflets and publicity notices that circulated through Paris’s intellectual and fashionable circles. Such PR efforts eventually led to a treaty with France that helped the colonists win their freedom from Great Britain.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_082">Walter Isaacson, <em class="emphasis">Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</em> (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 2003), 325–349.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s05_p02">Famous 20th-century PR campaigns include President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Fireside Chats, a series of radio addresses that explained aspects of the New Deal. Roosevelt’s personal tone and his familiarity with the medium of radio helped the Fireside Chats become an important promotional tool for his administration and its programs. These chats aimed to justify many New Deal policies, and they helped the president bypass the press and speak directly to the people. More recently, Blackwater Worldwide, a private military company, dealt with criticisms of its actions in Iraq by changing its name. The new name, Xe Services, was the result of a large-scale PR campaign to distance the company from associations with civilian violence.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_083">Associated Press, “Blackwater Ditches Tarnished Brand Name,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, February 13, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2009-02-13-blackwater_N.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/military/2009-02-13-blackwater_N.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s05_p03">The proliferation of media outlets and the 24-hour news cycle have led to changes in the way politicians handle PR. The gap between old PR methods and new ones became evident in 2006, when then–Vice President Dick Cheney accidentally shot a friend during a hunting trip. Cheney, who had been criticized in the past for being secretive, did not make a statement about the accident for three days. Republican consultant Rich Galen explained Cheney’s silence as an older PR tactic that tries to keep the discussion out of the media. However, the old trick is less effective in the modern digital world.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s05_p06">PR techniques have been used in propaganda efforts throughout the 20th century. During the 1990s, the country of Kuwait employed Hill &amp; Knowlton to encourage U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf region. One of the more infamous examples of their campaign was a heavily reported account by a Kuwaiti girl testifying that Iraqi troops had dumped babies out of incubators in Kuwaiti hospitals. Outrage over this testimony helped galvanize opinion in favor of U.S. involvement. As it turned out, the Kuwaiti girl was really the daughter of the Kuwaiti ambassador and had not actually witnessed any of the alleged atrocities.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_085">Patricia Parsons, <em class="emphasis">Ethics in Public Relations</em> (Sterling, VA: Chartered Institute of Public Relations, 2005), 7.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s05_p07">Lobbyists also attempt to influence public policy using PR campaigns. The Water Environment Federation, a lobbying group representing the sewage industry, initiated a campaign to promote the application of sewage on farms during the early 1990s. The campaign came up with the word <em class="emphasis">biosolids</em> to replace the term <em class="emphasis">sludge</em>. Then it worked to encourage the use of this term as a way to popularize sewage as a fertilizer, providing information to public officials and representatives. In 1992, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted the new term and changed the classification of biosolids to a fertilizer from a hazardous waste. This renaming helped New York City eliminate tons of sewage by shipping it to states that allowed biosolids.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_086">John Stauber and Sheldon Rampton, <em class="emphasis">Toxic Sludge is Good for You!</em> (Monroe, ME: Common Courage Press, 1995), 105–119.</span></p>

A consistently popular political brand is that of the outsider, or reform-minded politician. Despite his many years of service in the U.S. Senate, John McCain famously adopted this brand during the 2008 presidential election. McCain’s competitor, Barack Obama, also employed branding strategies. The Obama campaign featured several iconic portraits and slogans that made for a consistent brand and encouraged his victory in 2008.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s02_s06_p01">That so many different groups have adopted branding as a means of communication is a testament to its ubiquity.

Social media sites have also encouraged branding techniques by allowing users to create profiles of themselves that they use to communicate their core values.
