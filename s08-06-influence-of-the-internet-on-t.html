    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_p01">In March of 2010, <em class="emphasis">Consumerist</em> published a story titled “Print edition of <em class="emphasis">TV Guide</em> tells me to go online to read most of cover story.” According to the article, <em class="emphasis">TV Guide</em> printed a story listing “TV’s Top 50 Families,” but shocked readers by including only the top 20 families in its print version. To discover the rest of the list, readers needed to go online.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_090">Phil Villarreal, “Print Edition of <em class="emphasis">TV Guide</em> Tells Me to Go Online to Read Most of Cover Story,” <em class="emphasis">Consumerist</em> (blog), March 30, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://consumerist.com/2010/03/print-edition-of-tv-guide-tells-me-to-go-online-to-read-most-of-cover-story.html">http://consumerist.com/2010/03/print-edition-of-tv-guide-tells-me-to-go-online-to-read-most-of-cover-story.html</a>.</span> As dismayed as some readers were, this story reflects an ongoing trend in magazine journalism: the move toward online reporting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_p02">Just like their newspaper cousins, magazines have been greatly affected by the influence of the Internet. With so much information available online, advertisers and readers are accessing content on the Internet, causing declines in both revenue and readership. These changes are forcing magazines to adapt to an increasingly online market.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Online-Only Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p01">In 1995, <em class="emphasis">Salon</em> launched the first major online-only magazine at <a class="link" href="http://www.salon.com">http://www.salon.com</a>. “Salon, the award-winning online news and entertainment website, combines original investigative stories, breaking news, provocative personal essays and highly respected criticism along with popular staff-written blogs about politics, technology and culture.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_091"><em class="emphasis">Salon</em>, “Salon Fact Sheet,” <a class="link" href="http://www.salon.com/press/fact/">http://www.salon.com/press/fact/</a>.</span> Like many print magazines, the site divides content into sections including entertainment, books, comics, life, news and politics, and technology and business. With an average of 5.8 million monthly unique visitors, this online magazine demonstrates the potential successes of Internet-based publications.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_092"><em class="emphasis">Salon</em>, “Salon Fact Sheet,” <a class="link" href="http://www.salon.com/press/fact/">http://www.salon.com/press/fact/</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p02">Other online-only magazines include <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> and <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>. All three magazines, like most online publications, support themselves in part through ads that appear alongside articles and other content. Founded in 1996, <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> is a “general interest publication offering analysis and commentary about politics, news, and culture.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_093"><em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, “About Us: Everything you need to know about <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>,” <a class="link" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/">http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/</a>.</span> Considering itself “a daily magazine on the Web,” <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> offers its readers information on news and politics, arts, life, business, technology, and science via online articles, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">podcasts</a><span class="glossdef">Audio content broadcast over the Internet.</span></span>, and blogs.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_094"><em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, “About Us: Everything you need to know about <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>,” <a class="link" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/">http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/</a>.</span> The successful magazine has been recognized with numerous awards for its contributions to journalism.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> differs somewhat from <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> or <em class="emphasis">Salon</em> in that it was originally a print publication. First published in 1982, the computer magazine published hard-copy issues for over 15 years before announcing in 2008 that its January 2009 issue would be its last printed edition. In an open letter to its readers, <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> discussed the transition:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p04">Starting in February 2009, <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> will become a 100-percent digital publication. So, in addition to our popular network of Websites … we’ll offer <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine Digital Edition</em> to all of our print subscribers. The <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine Digital Edition</em> has actually been available since 2002. So for thousands of you, the benefits of this unique medium are already clear. And those benefits will continue to multiply in the coming months, as we work hard to enhance your digital experience.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_095">Lance Ulanoff, “<em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> Goes 100% Digital,” (2008), <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p05">While it is perhaps fitting that this computer-focused publication is one of the first print magazines to move to an entirely online form, its reasons for the transition were financial rather than creative. In describing the decision, Jason Young, chief executive of Ziff Davis Media, said, “[t]he viability for us to continue to publish in print just isn’t there anymore.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_096">Stephanie Clifford, “<em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>, a Flagship for Ziff Davis, Will Cease Printing a Paper Version,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 19, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/business/media/20mag.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/business/media/20mag.html</a>.</span> Unfortunately for the magazine industry, Young’s sentiment reflects a trend that has been building for some time. Several other publications have followed in <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>’s footsteps, making the move from print to online-only. Journals such as <em class="emphasis">Elle Girl</em> and <em class="emphasis">Teen People</em> that were once available in print can now be viewed only via the Internet. As printing costs rise and advertising and subscription revenues decrease, more magazines will likely be making similar shifts.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Magazine-Like Websites</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_s01_p01">In recent years, websites that function much as magazines once did without officially being publications themselves have become an increasingly popular online model. For example, Pitchfork Media is an Internet publication on the music industry. Established in 1995, the site offers readers criticism and commentary on contemporary music and has many of the same features as a traditional music magazine: reviews, news, articles, and interviews. Whether the site is capitalizing on the success of print magazines by following their format or if it is simply responding to its readers by providing them with an accessible online experience is a debatable point. Of course, the website also has many features that would not be available in print, such as a streaming playlist of music and music videos. This hybrid of magazine-like content with new-media content offers a possible vision of the digital future of print publications.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Print Magazines with Online Presences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p01">Indeed, most print magazines have created websites. Nearly every major print publication has a site available either for free or through subscription. Yet there are intrinsic differences between the print and online media. Bernadette Geyer, author of a poetry chapbook, <em class="emphasis">What Remains</em>, discusses the practical contrasts between online and print journals:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p02">I will read a print journal cover to cover because I can bookmark where I left off…. Simply taking all the of the content of what would have been a print issue and putting it online with links from a Table of Contents is all well and good in theory, but I have to ask, how many people actually sit and read all of the contents of an online journal that publishes several authors/genres per issue?<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_097">Bernadette Geyer, “Online vs. Print Journal Models,” <em class="emphasis">Bernadette Geyer: Livin’ the Literary Life in the Exiles of Suburbia</em> (blog), March 9, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://bernadettegeyer.blogspot.com/2010/03/online-vs-print-journal-models.html">http://bernadettegeyer.blogspot.com/2010/03/online-vs-print-journal-models.html</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p03">Her question is a good one, and one which most magazines have already asked themselves. In light of this dilemma, magazines with online editions have sought ways to attract readers who may not, in fact, read much. Most websites also include online-only content such as blogs, podcasts, and daily news updates that, naturally, are not available in print form. The additional features on magazines’ websites likely stem from a need to attract audiences with shorter attention spans and less time to devote to reading entire articles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p04">Another way that magazines court online readers is by offering back-issue content. Readers can browse old articles without having to remember in which issue the content first appeared. The cost for this varies from publication to publication. For example, <a class="link" href="http://CooksIllustrated.com">CooksIllustrated.com</a> reprints recipes from previous issues as part of a paid online membership service, while <a class="link" href="http://CookingLight.com">CookingLight.com</a> offers back issues for free. Some magazines have online archive collections, though those collections generally do not print entire articles or complete issues. <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, for example, offers “hand-picked covers and excerpts from the best articles on a wide variety of subjects.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_098"><em class="emphasis">Time</em>, “<em class="emphasis">Time</em> Magazine Archives,” <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/">http://www.time.com/time/archive/</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">Time</em> suggests that one should “use them as chronological guides to <em class="emphasis">Time</em>’s past coverage of a person, event, or topic.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_099"><em class="emphasis">Time</em>, “<em class="emphasis">Time</em> Magazine Archives,” <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/">http://www.time.com/time/archive/</a>.</span> Still, even without the entire collection online, there is a distinct benefit of being able to search back for articles from 1923 from a computer.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Is Print Dead?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s03_p01">The question <em class="emphasis">Is print dead?</em> has dominated the magazine and newspaper industries for several years. In 2008, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> printed an article titled “Mourning Old Media’s Decline,” in which author David Carr describes multiple announcements of job loss in the print industry. Thousands of individuals working at magazines and newspapers faced layoffs because of reduced subscriber and advertiser demand. “Clearly the sky is falling,” he writes, “The question now is how many people will be left to cover it.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_100">David Carr, “Mourning Old Media’s Decline,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 28, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html</a>.</span> At the same time, Carr articulates the shift in readership from print to web, saying, “The paradox of all these announcements is that newspapers and magazines do not have an audience problem—newspaper websites are a vital source of news, and growing—but they do have a consumer problem.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_101">David Carr, “Mourning Old Media’s Decline,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 28, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html</a>.</span> With a majority of magazines and newspapers now available for free online, one has to wonder how the industry will stay afloat. Although advertisements pay for a portion of the cost of running a magazine, it may not be enough.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s03_p02">The debate over whether print is still viable is a heated one that is infiltrating the magazine industry. At a 2006 magazine editorial meeting, <em class="emphasis">Glamour</em>’s editor in chief, Cindi Leive, claimed that she “loves this question…. Is print dead? Discuss!”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_102">Dorian Benkoil and Dylan Stableford, “Is Print Dead? Discuss!” Mediabistro.com, November 17, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a9077.asp">http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a9077.asp</a>.</span> The editor in chief of <em class="emphasis">More</em> magazine responded to the statement saying, “[i]t’s what we talk about all day long.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_103">Dorian Benkoil and Dylan Stableford, “Is Print Dead? Discuss!” Mediabistro.com, November 17, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a9077.asp">http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a9077.asp</a>.</span> But for as many people who are fighting for the print industry to remain profitable, there is an equally vocal group arguing for the elimination of the print medium altogether. In a 2005 published debate on the topic, former print editor-turned-blogger Jeff Jarvis squared off against John Griffin, president of the National Geographic Society’s magazine group. Jarvis claimed, “Print is not dead. Print is where words go to die.” But Griffin countered, “Actually print is where words go to live—we’re still reading the ancient Greeks.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_104">Jeff Jarvis and John Griffin, “Is Print Doomed?” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 1, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/open-debate-extra.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/open-debate-extra.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s03_p03">Regardless of your position, the fact that the print industry is facing hardships is unquestionable. Magazines are rethinking their marketing strategies to remain viable in an increasingly online world. But many are hopeful that journals will find a way to publish both in print and on the Internet. After all, “[t]here’s something special and unique, even luxurious about reading a big, glossy magazine…. Or, in the words of <em class="emphasis">Marie Claire</em> editor Joanna Coles, ‘As long as people take baths, there will always be a monthly magazine.’”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_105">Dorian Benkoil and Dylan Stableford, “Is Print Dead?
