    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_p01">Early radio network programming laid the groundwork for television’s format, with many different programs that appealed to a variety of people broadcast at different times of the day. As television’s popularity grew, however, radio could not compete and so it turned to fresh programming techniques. A new type of format-driven station became the norm. Propelled by the development of new types of music such as psychedelic rock and smooth jazz, the evolution of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">radio station formats</a><span class="glossdef">A template for radio stations that determines the type of music that will be played and the audience that will be targeted.</span></span> took place. Since the beginning of this shift, different stations have tended to focus on the music that certain demographics preferred. For example, many people raised on Top 40 radio of the 1950s and 1960s did not necessarily want to hear modern pop hits, so stations playing older popular songs emerged to meet their needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_p02">Modern formats take into account aging generations, with certain stations specifically playing the pop hits of the 1950s and early 1960s, and others focusing on the pop hits of the late 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. These formats have developed to target narrow, defined audiences with predictable tastes and habits. Ratings services such as Arbitron can identify the 10-year age <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">demographic</a><span class="glossdef">A single statistic of a human population, such as age or income.</span></span>, the education level, and even the political leanings of listeners who prefer a particular format. Because advertisers want their commercials to reach an audience likely to buy their products, this kind of audience targeting is crucial for advertising revenue.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_p01">The following top radio formats and their respective statistics were determined by an Arbitron survey that was released in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_064">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010.</span> The most popular formats and subformats cover a wide range of demographics, revealing radio’s wide appeal.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s01_p01">Country music as a format includes stations devoted both to older and newer country music. In 2010, the country music format stood as the most popular radio format, beating out even such prominent nonmusic formats as news and talk. The format commanded the greatest listener share and the second largest number of stations dedicated to the style. Favored in rural regions of the country, the country music format—featuring artists like Keith Urban, the Dixie Chicks, and Tim McGraw—appeals to both male and female listeners from a variety of income levels.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_065">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010, 15–18.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s02_p01">The news/talk/information format includes AM talk radio, public radio stations with talk programming, network news radio, sports radio, and personality talk radio. This format reached nearly 59 million listeners in 2010, appealing particularly to those aged 65 and older; over 70 percent of its listeners had attended college.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s03_p01">Generally targeted toward individuals over 30, the adult contemporary (AC) format favors pop music from the last 15 to 20 years as opposed to current hits. Different subformats, such as hot AC and modern AC, target younger audiences by playing songs that are more current. In 2010, the majority of AC audience were affluent, married individuals divided roughly along the national average politically. Adult contemporary listeners ranked highest by format in at-work listening. Hot AC, a subformat of AC that plays more current hits, ranked seventh in the nation. Urban AC, a version of AC that focuses on older R&amp;B hits, ranked eighth in the nation in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_067">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010, 23–26.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s04_p01">Pop contemporary hit radio, or pop CHR, is a subformat of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">contemporary hit radio (CHR)</a><span class="glossdef">A Top 40-derived radio format that pulls from many different genres.</span></span>. Other subformats of CHR include dance CHR and rhythmic CHR. Branded in the 1980s, this format encompasses stations that have a Top 40 orientation but draw on a wide number of formats, such as country, rock, and urban. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_068">John Ford, “Contemporary Hit Radio,” September 2, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://radioindustry.suite101.com/article.cfm/contemporary_hit_radio_history">http://radioindustry.suite101.com/article.cfm/contemporary_hit_radio_history</a>.</span> In 2010, pop CHR ranked first among teenaged listeners, with 65 percent of its overall listeners aged under 35. This music, ranging from popular artists like Taylor Swift and Kanye West to Shakira, was played in the car more than at home or work and saw its largest listening times in the evenings. Rhythmic CHR, a subformat focusing on a mix of rhythmic pop, R&amp;B, dance, and hip-hop hits, also ranked high in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_069">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010. 27–30.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s05_p01">Classic rock stations generally play rock singles from the 1970s and 1980s, like “Stairway to Heaven,” by Led Zeppelin, and “You Shook Me All Night Long,” by AC/DC. Another distinct but similar format is album-oriented rock (AOR). This format focuses on songs that were not necessarily released as singles, also known as album cuts.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_070">“Rock and Alternative Music Formats,” <em class="emphasis">Radio Station World</em>, 1996–2010, <a class="link" href="http://radiostationworld.com/directory/Radio_Formats/radio_formats_rock.asp">http://radiostationworld.com/directory/Radio_Formats/radio_formats_rock.asp</a>.</span> In 2010, classic rock stations ranked fifth in listener figures. These individuals were overwhelmingly men (70 percent) between the ages of 35 and 54 (54 percent). Classic rock was most often listened to in the car and at work, with only 26 percent of its listeners tuning in at home.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_071">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010. 32–34.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s06_p01">The urban contemporary format plays modern hits from mainly black artists—such as Lil Wayne, John Legend, and Ludacris—featuring a mix of soul, hip-hop, and R&amp;B. In 2010, the format ranked eleventh in the nation. Urban contemporary focuses on listeners in the 18–34 age range.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_072">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010, 55–58.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s07_p01">The Mexican regional format is devoted to Spanish-language music, particularly Mexican and South American genres. In 2010, it ranked thirteenth in the nation and held the top spot in Los Angeles, a reflection of the rise in immigration from Mexico, Central America, and South America. Mexican regional’s listener base was over 96 percent Hispanic, and the format was most popular in the Western and Southwestern regions of the country. However, it was less popular in the Eastern regions of the country; in New England, for example, the format held a zero percent share of listening. The rise of the Mexican regional format illustrates the ways in which radio can change rapidly to meet new demographic trends.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_073">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010, 63–66.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s07_p02">An increasingly Spanish language–speaking population in the United States has also resulted in a number of distinct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Spanish-language radio formats</a><span class="glossdef">Radio formats that target Spanish-speaking audiences, including talk, religious, and popular music formats.</span></span>. These include Spanish oldies, Spanish adult hits, Spanish religious, Spanish tropical, and Spanish talk among others. Tejano, a type of music developed in Hispanic Texan communities, has also gained enough of an audience to become a dedicated format.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_074">Arbitron Inc., <em class="emphasis">Radio Today: How America Listens to Radio</em>, 2010, 13.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s08_p01">Radio formats have become so specialized that ratings group Arbitron includes more than 50 designations. What was once simply called rock music has been divided into such subformats as alternative and modern rock. Alternative rock began as a format played on college stations during the 1980s but developed as a mainstream format during the following decade, thanks in part to the popular grunge music of that era. As this music aged, stations began using the term modern rock to describe a format dedicated to new rock music. This format has also spawned the active rock format, which plays modern rock hits with older rock hits thrown in.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_075">“Rock and Alternative Music Formats,” <em class="emphasis">Radio Station World</em>, 1996–2010, <a class="link" href="http://radiostationworld.com/directory/Radio_Formats/radio_formats_rock.asp">http://radiostationworld.com/directory/Radio_Formats/radio_formats_rock.asp</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s08_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Nostalgia</a><span class="glossdef">Radio formats that play a particular era or combination of eras.</span></span> formats have split into a number of different formats as well. Oldies stations now generally focus on hits from the 1950s and 1960s, while the classic hits format chooses from hits of the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Urban oldies, which focuses on R&amp;B, soul, and other urban music hits from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, has also become a popular radio format. Formats such as adult hits mix older songs from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s with a small selection of popular music, while formats such as ’80s hits picks mainly from the 1980s.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_076">“Oldies, Adult Hits, and Nostalgia Radio Formats,” <em class="emphasis">Radio Station World</em>, 1996–2010, <a class="link" href="http://radiostationworld.com/directory/radio_formats/radio_formats_oldies.asp">http://radiostationworld.com/directory/radio_formats/radio_formats_oldies.asp</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_s08_p03">Radio station formats are an interesting way to look at popular culture in the United States. The evolution of nostalgia formats to include new decades nods to the size and tastes of the nation’s aging listeners. Hits of the 1980s are popular enough with their demographic to have entire stations dedicated to them, while other generations prefer stations with a mix of decades. The rise of the country format and the continued popularity of the classic rock format are potential indicators of cultural trends.</p>
