Contemporary consumers relate to and identify with brands and products. Advertising has inspired an independent press and conspired to encourage carcinogenic addictions. An exceedingly human invention, advertising is an unavoidable aspect of the shared modern experience.</p>

Historians have used the city’s archaeological evidence to piece together many aspects of ancient life. Pompeii’s ruins reveal a world in which the fundamental tenets of commerce and advertising were already in place. Merchants offered different brands of fish sauces identified by various names such as “Scaurus’ tunny jelly.” Wines were branded as well, and their manufacturers sought to position them by making claims about their prestige and quality. Toys and other merchandise found in the city bear the names of famous athletes, providing, perhaps, the first example of endorsement techniques.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_004">John Hood, <em class="emphasis">Selling the Dream: Why Advertising Is Good Business</em> (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2005), 12–13.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_s01_p02">The invention of the printing press in 1440 made it possible to print advertisements that could be put up on walls and handed out to individuals. By the 1600s, newspapers had begun to include advertisements on their pages. Advertising revenue allowed newspapers to print independently of secular or clerical authority, eventually achieving daily circulation. By the end of the 16th century, most newspapers contained at least some advertisements.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_005">William M.

When European trading companies realized that the Americas held economic potential as a source of natural resources such as timber, fur, and tobacco, they attempted to convince others to cross the Atlantic Ocean and work to harvest this bounty. The advertisements for this venture described a paradise without beggars and with plenty of land for those who made the trip.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p01">The rise of the penny press during the 1800s had a profound effect on advertising. The <em class="emphasis">New York Sun</em> embraced a novel advertising model in 1833 that allowed it to sell issues of the paper for a trifling amount of money, ensuring a higher circulation and a wider audience.

            <h3 class="title">P. T. Barnum and Advertising</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p02">The career of P. T. Barnum, cofounder of the famed Barnum &amp; Bailey circus, gives a sense of the uncontrolled nature of advertising during the 1800s. He began his career in the 1840s writing ads for a theater, and soon after, he began promoting his own shows. He advertised these shows any way he could, using not only interesting newspaper ads but also bands of musicians, paintings on the outside of his buildings, and street-spanning banners.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p03">Barnum also learned the effectiveness of using the media to gain attention. In an early publicity stunt, Barnum hired a man to wordlessly stack bricks at various corners near his museum during the hours preceding a show. When this activity drew a crowd, the man went to the museum and bought a ticket for the show. This stunt drew such large crowds over the next two days, that the police made Barnum put a halt to it, gaining it even wider media attention. Barnum was sued for fraud over a bearded woman featured in one of his shows; the plaintiffs claimed that she was, in fact, a man. Rather than trying to keep the trial quiet, Barnum drew attention to it by parading a crowd of witnesses attesting to the bearded woman’s gender, drawing more media attention—and more customers.</p>

            </div>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p04">Barnum aimed to make his audience think about what they had seen for an extended time. His Feejee mermaid—actually a mummified monkey and fish sewn together—was not necessarily interesting because viewers thought the creation was really a mermaid, but because they weren’t sure if it was or not. Such marketing tactics brought Barnum’s shows out of his establishments and into social conversations and newspapers.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_008">Edd Applegate, <em class="emphasis">Personalities and Products: A Historical Perspective on Advertising in America</em> (Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1998), 57–64.</span> Although most companies today would eschew Barnum’s outrageous style, many have used the media and a similar sense of mystery to promote their products. Apple, for example, famously keeps its products such as the iPhone and iPad under wraps, building media anticipation and coverage.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p05">In 1843, a salesman named Volney Palmer founded the first U.S. advertising agency in Philadelphia. The agency made money by linking potential advertisers with newspapers. By 1867, other agencies had formed, and advertisements were being marketed at the national level. During this time, George Rowell, who made a living buying bulk advertising space in newspapers to subdivide and sell to advertisers, began conducting market research in its modern recognizable form. He used surveys and circulation counts to estimate numbers of readers and anticipate effective advertising techniques. His agency gained an advantage over other agencies by offering advertising space most suited for a particular product. This trend quickly caught on with other agencies. In 1888, Rowell started the first advertising trade magazine, <em class="emphasis">Printers’ Ink</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_009">Ellen Gartrell, “More About Early Advertising Publications,” Digital Collections, Duke University Libraries, <a class="link" href="http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/eaa/printlit.html">http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/eaa/printlit.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p01">Another ubiquitous aspect of advertising developed around this time: brands. During most of the 19th century, consumers purchased goods in bulk, weighing out scoops of flour or sugar from large store barrels and paying for them by the pound. Innovations in industrial packaging allowed companies to mass produce bags, tins, and cartons with brand names on them. Although brands existed before this time, they were generally reserved for goods that were inherently recognizable, such as china or furniture. Advertising a particular kind of honey or flour made it possible for customers to ask for that product by name, giving it an edge over the unnamed competition.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_011">Christina B.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_s01_p02">The rise of department stores during the late 1800s also gave brands a push. Nationwide outlets such as Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company and Montgomery Ward sold many of the same items to consumers all over the country. A particular item spotted in a big-city storefront could come to a small-town shopper’s home thanks to mail-order catalogs. Customers made associations with the stores, trusting them to have a particular kind of item and to provide quality wares. Essentially, consumers came to trust the store’s name rather than its specific products.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_012">John Hood, <em class="emphasis">Selling the Dream: Why Advertising Is Good Business</em> (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2005), 28–51.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_p01">Although advertising was becoming increasingly accepted as an element of mass media, many still regarded it as an unseemly occupation. This attitude began to change during the early 20th century. As magazines—widely considered a highbrow medium—began using more advertising, the advertising profession began attracting more artists and writers. Writers used verse and artists produced illustrations to embellish advertisements. Not surprisingly, this era gave rise to commercial jingles and iconic brand characters such as the Jolly Green Giant and the Pillsbury Doughboy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_p02">The household cleaner Sapolio produced advertisements that made the most of the artistic advertising trend. Sapolio’s ads featured various drawings of the residents of “Spotless Town” along with a rhymed verse celebrating the virtues of this fictional haven of cleanliness. The public anticipated each new ad in much the same way people today anticipate new television episodes. In fact, the ads became so popular that citizens passed “Spotless Town” resolutions to clean up their own jurisdictions. Advertising trends later moved away from flowery writing and artistry, but the lessons of those memorable campaigns continued to influence the advertising profession for years to come.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_013">Stephen Fox, <em class="emphasis">The Mirror Makers</em> (New York: William Morrow, 1984), 41–46.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s01_p01">World War I fueled an advertising and propoganda boom. Corporations that had switched to manufacturing wartime goods wanted to stay in the public eye by advertising their patriotism. Equally, the government needed to encourage public support for the war, employing such techniques as the famous Uncle Sam recruiting poster. President Woodrow Wilson established the advertiser-run Committee on Public Information to make movies and posters, write speeches, and generally sell the war to the public. Advertising helped popularize World War I on the homefront, and the war in turn gave advertising a much-needed boost in stature. The postwar return to regular manufacturing initiated the 1920s as an era of unprecedented advertising.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_014">Stephen Fox, <em class="emphasis">The Mirror Makers</em> (New York: William Morrow, 1984), 74–77.</span></p>

Although many initially thought radio was too intrusive a medium to allow advertising, as it entered people’s homes by the end of the decade, advertising had become an integral aspect of programming. Advertising agencies often created their own programs that networks then distributed. As advertisers conducted surveys and researched prime time slots, radio programming changed to appeal to their target demographics. The famous <em class="emphasis">Lux Radio Theater</em>, for example, was named for and sponsored by a brand of soap. Product placement was an important part of these early radio programs.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s03_p01">Unsurprisingly, the Great Depression, with its widespread decreases in levels of income and buying power, had a negative effect on advertising. Spending on ads dropped to a mere 38 percent of its previous level. Social reformers added to revenue woes by again questioning the moral standing of the advertising profession. Books such as <em class="emphasis">Through Many Windows</em> and <em class="emphasis">Our Master’s Voice</em> portrayed advertisers as dishonest and cynical, willing to say anything to make a profit and unconcerned about their influence on society. Humorists also questioned advertising’s authority. The Depression-era magazine <em class="emphasis">Ballyhoo</em> regularly featured parodies of ads, similar to those seen later on <em class="emphasis">Saturday Night Live</em> or in <em class="emphasis">The Onion</em>. These ads mocked the claims that had been made throughout the 1920s, further reducing advertising’s public standing.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_018">Stephen Fox, <em class="emphasis">The Mirror Makers</em> (New York: William Morrow, 1984), 121–124.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s03_p02">This advertising downturn lasted only as long as the Depression.

The rising consumer movement made false and misleading advertising a major public policy issue. At the time, companies such as Fleischmann’s (which claimed its yeast could cure crooked teeth) were using advertisements to pitch misleading assertions. Only business owners’ personal morals stood in the way of such claims until 1938, when the federal government created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and gave it the authority to halt false advertising.</p>

These sponsors had total control over programs such as <em class="emphasis">Goodyear TV Playhouse</em> and <em class="emphasis">Kraft Television Theatre</em>. Some sponsors went as far as to manipulate various aspects of the programs. In one instance, a program run by the DeSoto car company asked a contestant to use a false name rather than his given name, Ford. The present-day network model of television advertising took hold during the 1950s as the costs of television production made sole sponsorship of a show prohibitive for most companies. Rather than having a single sponsor, the networks began producing their own shows, paying for them through ads sold to a number of different sponsors.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_022">Stephen Fox, <em class="emphasis">The Mirror Makers</em> (New York: William Morrow, 1984), 210–215.</span> Under the new model of advertising, television producers had much more creative control than they had under the sole-sponsorship model.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s04_p03">The quiz shows of the 1950s were the last of the single-sponsor–produced programs. In 1958, when allegations of quiz show fraud became national news, advertisers moved out of programming entirely. The quiz show scandals also added to an increasing scepticism of ads and consumer culture.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_023">William Boddy, “The Seven Dwarfs and the Money Grubbers: The Public Relations Crisis of US Television in the Late 1950s,” in <em class="emphasis">Logics of Television: Essays in Cultural Criticism</em>, ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s04_p04">Advertising research during the 1950s had used scientifically driven techniques to attempt to influence consumer opinion. Although the effectiveness of this type of advertising is questionable, the idea of consumer manipulation through scientific methods became an issue for many Americans. Vance Packard’s best-selling 1957 book <em class="emphasis">The Hidden Persuaders</em> targeted this style of advertising. <em class="emphasis">The Hidden Persuaders</em> and other books like it were part of a growing critique of 1950s consumer culture. The U.S. public was becoming increasingly wary of advertising claims— not to mention increasingly weary of ads themselves. A few adventurous ad agencies used this consumer fatigue to usher in a new era of advertising and American culture.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_024">Thomas Frank, <em class="emphasis">The Conquest of Cool</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998), 41.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s05_p01">Burdened by association with Nazi Germany, where the company had originated, Volkswagen took a daring risk during the 1950s. In 1959, the Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB) agency initiated an ad campaign for the company that targeted skeptics of contemporary culture. Using a frank personal tone with the audience and making fun of the planned obsolescence that was the hallmark of Detroit automakers, the campaign stood apart from other advertisements of the time. It used many of the consumer icons of the 1950s, such as suburbia and game shows, in a satirical way, pitting Volkswagen against mainstream conformity and placing it strongly on the side of the consumer. By the end of the 1960s, the campaign had become an icon of American anticonformity. In fact, it was such a success that other automakers quickly emulated it. Ads for the Dodge Fever, for example, mocked corporate values and championed rebellion.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_025">Thomas Frank, <em class="emphasis">The Conquest of Cool</em> (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1998), 60–67, 159.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s05_p02">This era of advertising became known as the “creative revolution” for its emphasis on creativity over straight salesmanship. The creative revolution reflected the values of the growing anticonformist movement that culminated in the countercultural revolution of the 1960s. The creativity and anticonformity of 1960s advertising quickly gave way to more product-oriented conventional ads during the 1970s. Agency conglomeration, a recession, and cultural fallout were all factors in the recycling of older ad techniques. Major television networks dropped their long-standing ban on comparative advertising early in the decade, leading to a new trend in positioning ads that compared products. Advertising wars such as Coke versus Pepsi and, later, Microsoft versus Apple were products of this trend.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_026">Stephen Fox, <em class="emphasis">The Mirror Makers</em> (New York: William Morrow, 1984), 324–325.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s05_p03">Innovations in the 1980s stemmed from a new television channel: MTV. Producers of youth-oriented products created ads featuring music and focusing on stylistic effects, mirroring the look and feel of music videos. By the end of the decade, this style had extended to more mainstream products. Campaigns for the pain reliever Nuprin featured black-and-white footage with bright yellow pills, whereas ads for Michelob used grainy atmospheric effects.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_027"><em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, “How MTV Has Rocked Television Commercials,” October 9, 1989, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/09/business/the-media-business-how-mtv-has-rocked-television-commercials.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/09/business/the-media-business-how-mtv-has-rocked-television-commercials.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s06_p01">During the late 1980s, studies showed that consumers were trending away from brands and brand loyalty. A recession coupled with general consumer fatigue led to an increase in generic brand purchases and a decrease in advertising. In 1983, marketing budgets allocated 70 percent of their expenditures to ads and the remaining 30 percent to other forms of promotion. By 1993, only 25 percent of marketing budgets were dedicated to ads.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_028">Naomi Klein, <em class="emphasis">No Logo</em> (New York: Picador, 2002), 14.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s03_s06_p02">These developments resulted in the rise of big-box stores such as Walmart that focused on low prices rather than expensive name brands. Large brands remade themselves during this period to focus less on their products and more on the ideas behind the brand. Nike’s “Just Do It” campaign, endorsed by basketball star Michael Jordan, gave the company a new direction and a new means of promotion. Nike representatives have stated they have become more of a “marketing-oriented company” as opposed to a product manufacturer.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_029">Naomi Klein, <em class="emphasis">No Logo</em> (New York: Picador, 2002), 12–22.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s04_p01">Despite the rise of digital media, many types of traditional advertising have proven their enduring effectiveness. Local advertisers and large corporations continue to rely on billboards and direct-mail fliers. In 2009, Google initiated a billboard campaign for its Google Apps products that targeted business commuters. The billboards featured a different message every day for an entire month, using simple computer text messages portraying a fictitious executive learning about the product.

A 45 percent drop in ad revenue between 2007 and 2010 signaled a catastrophic decline for the newspaper industry.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_032">Bruce Sterling, “More Newspaper Calamity,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, March 15, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/03/more-newspaper-calamity/">http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/2010/03/more-newspaper-calamity/</a>.</span> Traditionally, newspapers have made money through commercial and classified advertising. Commercial advertisers, however, have moved to electronic media forms, and classified ad websites such as Craigslist offer greater geographic coverage for free. The future of newspaper advertising—and of the newspaper industry as a whole—is up in the air.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s04_s01_p02">Print magazines have suffered from many of the same difficulties as newspapers. Declining advertising revenue has contributed to the end of popular magazines such as <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> and to the introduction of new magazines that cross over into other media formats, such as <em class="emphasis">Food Network Magazine</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s04_s02_p01">Compared to newspapers and magazines, radio’s advertising revenue has done well. Radio’s easy adaptation to new forms of communication has made it an easy sell to advertisers. Unlike newspapers, radio ads target specific consumers. Advertisers can also pay to have radio personalities read their ads live in the studio, adding a sense of personal endorsement to the business or product. Because newer forms of radio such as satellite and Internet stations have continued to use this model, the industry has not had as much trouble adapting as print media have.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s04_s03_p01">Television advertisement relies on verbal as well as visual cues to sell items. Promotional ad time is purchased by the advertiser, and a spot usually runs 15 to 30 seconds. Longer ads, known as infomercials, run like a television show and usually aim for direct viewer response. New technologies such as DVR allow television watchers to skip through commercials; however, studies have shown that these technologies do not have a negative effect on advertising.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_033">James Gallagher, “Duke Study: TiVo Doesn’t Hurt TV Advertising,” <em class="emphasis">Triangle Business Journal</em>, May 3, 2010, 20advertising<a class="link" href="http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2010/05/03/daily6.html">http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/stories/2010/05/03/daily6.html</a>.</span> This is party due to product placement. Product placement is an important aspect of television advertising, because it incorporates products into the plots of shows.

Although federal laws concerning these practices made plaintiffs prove that actual harm was done by the advertisement, state laws passed during the early 1920s allowed prosecution of misleading advertisements regardless of harm done.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_042">John Hood, <em class="emphasis">Selling the Dream: Why Advertising Is Good Business</em> (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2005), 74–75.</span> The National Association of Attorneys General has helped states remain an important part of advertising regulation.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s05_s01_p02">During the Great Depression, New Deal legislation threatened to outlaw any misleading advertising, a result of the burgeoning consumer movement and the public outcry against advertising during the period.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_044"><em class="emphasis">Time</em>, “The Press: Advertising v.

The 1938 Wheeler-Lea Amendment expanded the FTC’s role to protect consumers from deceptive advertising. Until this point, the FTC was responsible for addressing false advertising complaints from competitors. With this legislation, the agency also became an important resource for the consumer movement.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s05_s02_p01">In 1971, the FTC began the Advertising Substantiation Program to force advertisers to provide evidence for the claims in their advertisements. Under this program, the FTC gained the power to issue cease-and-desist orders to advertisers regarding specific ads in question and to order corrective advertising. Under this provision, the FTC can force a company to issue an advertisement acknowledging and correcting an earlier misleading ad. Regulations under this program established that supposed experts used in advertisements must be qualified experts in their field, and celebrities must actually use the products they endorse.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_045">Thomas O’Guinn, Chris Allen, and Richard Semenik, <em class="emphasis">Advertising and Integrated Brand Promotion</em> (Mason, OH: Cengage Learning, 2009), 131–137.</span> In 2006, Sunny Health Nutrition was brought to court for advertising height-enhancing pills called HeightMax. The FTC found the company had hired an actor to appear as an expert in its ads and that the pills did not live up to their claim.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s05_s02_p02">In 1992, the FTC introduced guidelines defining terms such as <em class="emphasis">biodegradable</em> and <em class="emphasis">recyclable</em>. The growth of the environmental movement in the early 1990s led to an upsurge in environmental claims by manufacturers and advertisers. For example, Mobil Oil claimed their Hefty trash bags were biodegradable.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s05_s03_p01">The FTC has also turned its attention to online advertising. The Children’s Online Privacy Act of 1998 was passed to prohibit companies from obtaining the personal information of children who access websites or other online resources. Because of the youth orientation of the Internet, newer advertising techniques have drawn increasing criticism. Alcohol companies in particular have come under scrutiny. Beer manufacturer Heineken’s online presence includes a virtual city in which users can own an apartment and use services such as email. This practice mirrors that of children’s advertising, in which companies often create virtual worlds to immerse children in their products. However, the age-verification requirements to participate in this type of environment are easily falsified and can lead to young children being exposed to more mature content.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_049">Amanda Gardner, “Alcohol Companies Use New Media to Lure Young Drinkers: Report,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em>, May 19, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/639266.html">http://www.businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/healthday/639266.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s05_s03_p02">Consumer and privacy advocates who are concerned over privacy intrusions by advertisers have also called for Internet ad regulation. In 2009, the FTC acted on complaints against Sears that resulted in an injunction against the company for not providing sufficient disclosure. Sears offered $10 to consumers to download a program that tracked their Internet browsing. The FTC came down on Sears because the downloaded software tracked sensitive information that was not fully disclosed to the consumer. Similar consumer complaints against Facebook and Google for their consumer tracking have, at present, not resulted in FTC actions; however, the growing outcry makes new regulation of Internet advertising likely.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_050">Mike Shields, “Pitching Self-Regulation,” <em class="emphasis">Adweek</em>, February 15, 2010.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_p01">Discussing advertising’s influence on culture raises a long-standing debate. One opinion states that advertising simply reflects the trends inherent in a culture, the other claims advertising takes an active role in shaping culture. Both ideas have merit and are most likely true to varying degrees.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s01_p03">Although Lewis’s fictional representation of a 1920s-era consumer may not be an actual person, it indicates the national consumer culture that was taking shape at the time. As it had always done, advertising sought to attach products to larger ideas and symbols of worth and cultural values. However, the rise of mass media and of the advertising models that these media embraced made advertising take on an increasingly influential cultural role.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s01_p04">Automobile ads of the 1920s portrayed cars as a new, free way of life rather than simply a means of transportation. Advertisers used new ideas about personal hygiene to sell products and ended up breaking taboos about public discussion of the body. The newly acknowledged epidemics of halitosis and body odor brought about products such as mouthwash and deodorant.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s02_p01">World War I bond campaigns had made it clear that advertising could be used to influence public beliefs and values. Advertising focused on the new—making new products and ideas seem better than older ones and ushering in a sense of the modernity. In an address to the American Association of Advertising Agencies in 1926, President Coolidge went as far as to hold advertisers responsible for the “regeneration and redemption of mankind.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_054">Roland Marchand, <em class="emphasis">Advertising the American Dream: Making Way for Modernity, 1920–1940</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), 7–9.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s02_p02">Up through the 1960s, most advertising agencies were owned and staffed by affluent white men, and advertising’s portrayals of typical American families reflected this status quo. Mainstream culture as propagated by magazine, radio, and newspaper advertising was that of middle- or upper-class white suburban families.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_055">Roland Marchand, <em class="emphasis">Advertising the American Dream: Making Way for Modernity, 1920–1940</em> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1985), 77–79.</span> This sanitized image of the suburban family, popularized in such TV programs as <em class="emphasis">Leave It to Beaver</em>, has been mercilessly satirized since the cultural backlash of the 1960s.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s02_p03">A great deal of that era’s cultural criticism targeted the image of the advertiser as a manipulator and promulgator of superficial consumerism. When advertisers for Volkswagen picked up on this criticism, turned it to their advantage, and created a new set of consumer symbols that would come to represent an age of rebellion, they neatly co-opted the arguments against advertising for their own purposes. In many instances, advertising has functioned as a codifier of its own ideals by taking new cultural values and turning them into symbols of a new phase of consumerism. This is the goal of effective advertising.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s02_p04">Apple’s 1984 campaign is one of the most well-known examples of defining a product in terms of new cultural trends.

The commercial showed a drab gray auditorium where identical individuals sat in front of a large screen.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s03_p01">The white, middle-class composition of ad agencies contributed to advertisements’ rare depictions of minority populations. DDB—the agency responsible for the Volkswagen ads of the 1960s—was an anomaly in this regard. One of its more popular ads was for Levy’s rye bread. Most conventional advertisers would have ignored the ethnic aspects of this product and simply marketed it to a mainstream white audience. Instead, the innovative agency created an ad campaign that made ethnic diversity a selling point, with spots featuring individuals from a variety of racial backgrounds eating the bread with the headline “You don’t have to be Jewish to love Levy’s.”</p>

Icons such as Aunt Jemima, the Cream of Wheat chef, and the Hiram Walker butler were some of the most recognizable black figures in U.S. culture. Unlike the African Americans who had gained fame through their artistry, scholarship, and athleticism, however, these advertising characters were famous for being domestic servants.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s06_s03_p03">During the 1960s, meetings of the American Association of Advertising Agencies (AAAA) hosted civil rights leaders, and agencies began to respond to the criticisms of bias. A New York survey in the mid-1960s discovered that blacks were underrepresented at advertising agencies. Many agencies responded by hiring new African American employees, and a number of black-owned agencies started in the 1970s.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_061">Stephen Fox, <em class="emphasis">The Mirror Makers</em> (New York: William Morrow, 1984), 278–284.</span></p>

Thus, women were well represented in advertising. However, those depictions presented women in extremely narrow roles. Through the 1960s, ads targeting women generally showed them performing domestic duties such as cooking or cleaning, whereas ads targeting men often placed women in a submissive sexual role even if the product lacked any overt sexual connotation. A National Car Rental ad from the early 1970s featured a disheveled female employee in a chair with the headline “Go Ahead, Take Advantage of Us.” Another ad from the 1970s pictured a man with new Dacron slacks standing on top of a woman, proclaiming, “It’s nice to have a girl around the house.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn12_062">Mark Frauenfelder, “Creepy Slacks Ad From 1970,” <em class="emphasis">Boing Boing</em>, (blog), May 12, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://boingboing.net/2008/05/12/creepy-slacks-ad-fro.html">http://boingboing.net/2008/05/12/creepy-slacks-ad-fro.html</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s07_p01">Although many people focus on advertising’s negative outcomes, the medium has provided unique benefits over time. Early newspaper advertising allowed newspapers to become independent of church and government control, encouraging the development of a free press with the ability to criticize powerful interests. When newspapers and magazines moved to an advertising model, these publications became accessible to large groups of people who previously could not afford them. Advertising also contributed to radio’s and television’s most successful eras. Radio’s golden age in the 1940s and television’s golden age in the 1950s both took place when advertisers were creating or heavily involved with the production of most of the programs.</p>

Many Internet services, such as email and smartphone applications, are only free because they feature advertising. Advertising allows promoters and service providers to reduce and sometimes eliminate the upfront purchase price, making these services available to a greater number of people and allowing lower economic classes to take part in mass culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch12_s01_s07_p03">Advertising has also been a longtime promoter of the arts. During the Renaissance, painters and composers often relied on wealthy patrons or governments to promote their work. Corporate advertising has given artists new means to fund their creative efforts. In addition, many artists and writers have been able to support themselves by working for advertisers. The use of music in commercials, particularly in recent years, has provided musicians with notoriety and income. Indeed, it is hard to imagine the cultural landscape of the United States without advertising.</p>
