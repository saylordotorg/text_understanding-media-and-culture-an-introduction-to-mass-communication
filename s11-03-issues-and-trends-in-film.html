The current economic situation in the film industry, with increased production and marketing costs and lower audience turnouts in theaters, often sets the standard for the films big studios are willing to invest in. If you wonder why theaters have released so many remakes and sequels in recent years, this section may help you to understand the motivating factors behind those decisions.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Influence of Hollywood</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p01">In the movie industry today, publicity and product are two sides of the same coin. Even films that get a lousy critical reception can do extremely well in ticket sales if their marketing campaigns manage to create enough hype. Similarly, two comparable films can produce very different results at the box office if they have been given different levels of publicity. This explains why the film <em class="emphasis">What Women Want</em>, starring Mel Gibson, brought in $33.6 million in its opening weekend in 2000, while a few months later, <em class="emphasis">The Million Dollar Hotel</em>, also starring Gibson, only brought in $29,483 during its opening weekend.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_077">Nash Information Services, “What Women Want,” <em class="emphasis">The Numbers: Box Office Data, Movie Stars, Idle Speculation</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.the-numbers.com/2000/WWWNT.php">http://www.the-numbers.com/2000/WWWNT.php</a>; Nash Information Services, “The Million Dollar Hotel,” <em class="emphasis">The Numbers: Box Office Data, Movie Stars, Idle Speculation</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.the-numbers.com/2001/BHOTL.php">http://www.the-numbers.com/2001/BHOTL.php</a>.</span> Unlike in the days of the Hollywood studio system, no longer do the actors alone draw audiences to a movie. The owners of the nation’s major movie theater chains are keenly aware that a film’s success at the box office has everything to do with studio-generated marketing and publicity. <em class="emphasis">What Women Want</em> was produced by Paramount, one of the film industry’s six leading studios, and widely released (on 3,000 screens) after an extensive marketing effort, while <em class="emphasis">The Million Dollar Hotel</em> was produced by Lionsgate, an independent studio without the necessary marketing budget to fill enough seats for a wide release on opening weekend.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_078">Edward Jay Epstein, “Neither the Power nor the Glory: Why Hollywood Leaves Originality to the Indies,” <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, October 17, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2128200">http://www.slate.com/id/2128200</a>.</span></p>

The films the studios churn out are the result of a capitalist enterprise that ultimately looks to the “bottom line” to guide most major decisions. Hollywood is an industry, and as in any other industry in a mass market, its success relies on control of production resources and “raw materials” and on its access to mass distribution and marketing strategies to maximize the product’s reach and minimize competition.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_081">John Belton, <em class="emphasis">American Cinema/American Culture</em>. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1994), 61–62.</span> In this way, Hollywood has an enormous influence on the films to which the public has access.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_p03">Ever since the rise of the studio system in the 1930s, the majority of films have originated with the leading Hollywood studios. Today, the six big studios control 95 percent of the film business.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_082">Kirby Dick, interview by Terry Gross, <em class="emphasis">Fresh Air</em>, <em class="emphasis">NPR</em>, September 13, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6068009">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6068009</a>.</span> In the early years, audiences were familiar with the major studios, their collections of actors and directors, and the types of films that each studio was likely to release. All of that changed with the decline of the studio system; screenwriters, directors, scripts, and cinematographers no longer worked exclusively with one studio, so these days, while moviegoers are likely to know the name of a film’s director and major actors, it’s unusual for them to identify a film with the studio that distributes it. However, studios are no less influential. The previews of coming attractions that play before a movie begins are controlled by the studios.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_083">Hillary Busis, “How Do Movie Theaters Decide Which Trailers to Show?” <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, April 15, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2246166/">http://www.slate.com/id/2246166/</a>.</span> Online marketing, TV commercials, and advertising partnerships with other industries—the name of an upcoming film, for instance, appearing on some Coke cans—are available tools for the big-budget studios that have the resources to commit millions to prerelease advertising. Even though studios no longer own the country’s movie theater chains, the films produced by the big six studios are the ones the multiplexes invariably show. Unlike films by independents, it’s a safe bet that big studio movies are the ones that will sell tickets.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Blockbuster Standard</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p01">While it may seem like the major studios are making heavy profits, moviemaking today is a much riskier, less profitable enterprise than it was in the studio system era. The massive budgets required for the global marketing of a film are huge financial gambles. In fact, most movies cost the studios much more to market and produce—upward of $100 million—than their box-office returns ever generate. With such high stakes, studios have come to rely on the handful of blockbuster films that keep them afloat,<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_084"><em class="emphasis">New World Encyclopedia</em>, s.v. “Film Industry,” <a class="link" href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hollywood">www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hollywood</a>.</span> movies like <em class="emphasis">Titanic</em>, <em class="emphasis">Pirates of the Caribbean</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Avatar</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_085"><em class="emphasis">New World Encyclopedia</em>, s.v. “Film Industry,” <a class="link" href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hollywood">www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Hollywood</a>.</span> The blockbuster film becomes a touchstone, not only for production values and story lines, but also for moviegoers’ expectations. Because studios know they can rely on certain predictable elements to draw audiences, they tend to invest the majority of their budgets on movies that fit the blockbuster mold. Remakes, movies with sequel setups, or films based on best-selling novels or comic books are safer bets than original screenplays or movies with experimental or edgy themes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s01_p02">James Cameron’s <em class="emphasis">Titanic</em> (1997), the second highest grossing movie of all time, saw such success largely because it was based on a well-known story, contained predictable plot elements, and was designed to appeal to the widest possible range of audience demographics with romance, action, expensive special effects, and an epic scope—meeting the blockbuster standard on several levels. The film’s astronomical $200 million production cost was a gamble indeed, requiring the backing of two studios, Paramount and 20th Century Fox.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_086">Steve Hanson and Sandra Garcia-Myers, “Blockbusters,” in <em class="emphasis">St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture</em>, ed. Sara Pendergast and Tom Pendergast (Detroit: St. James Press, 2000), vol. 1</span> However, the rash of high-budget, and high-grossing, films that have appeared since—<em class="emphasis">Harry Potter and the Sorceror’s Stone</em> and its sequels (2002–2011), <em class="emphasis">Avatar</em> (2009), <em class="emphasis">Alice in Wonderland</em> (2010), <em class="emphasis">The Lord of the Rings</em> films (2001–2003), <em class="emphasis">The Dark Knight</em> (2008), and others—are an indication that, for the time being, the blockbuster standard will drive Hollywood production.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Role of Independent Films</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p01">While the blockbuster still drives the industry, the formulaic nature of most Hollywood films of the 1980s, 1990s, and into the 2000s has opened a door for independent films to make their mark on the industry. Audiences have welcomed movies like <em class="emphasis">Fight Club</em> (1999), <em class="emphasis">Lost in Translation</em> (2003), and <em class="emphasis">Juno</em> (2007) as a change from standard Hollywood blockbusters. Few independent films reached the mainstream audience during the 1980s, but a number of developments in that decade paved the way for their increased popularity in the coming years. The Sundance Film Festival (originally the U.S. Film Festival) began in Park City, Utah, in 1980 as a way for independent filmmakers to showcase their work. Since then, the festival has grown to garner more public attention, and now often represents an opportunity for independents to find market backing by larger studios. In 1989, Steven Soderbergh’s <em class="emphasis">sex, lies, and videotape</em>, released by Miramax, was the first independent to break out of the art-house circuit and find its way into the multiplexes.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s01_s02_p02">In the 1990s and 2000s, independent directors like the Coen brothers, Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Quentin Tarantino made significant contributions to contemporary cinema. Tarantino’s 1994 film, <em class="emphasis">Pulp Fiction</em>, garnered attention for its experimental narrative structure, witty dialogue, and nonchalant approach to violence. It was the first independent film to break $100 million at the box office, proving that there is still room in the market for movies produced outside of the big six studios.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_087">Ronald Bergan, <em class="emphasis">Film</em> (New York: Dorling Kindersley, 2006), 84.</span></p>

In the eyes of many people, the problem is not the export of a U.S. product to outside markets, but the export of American culture that comes with that product. Just as films of the 1920s helped to shape a standardized, mass culture as moviegoers learned to imitate the dress and behavior of their favorite celebrities, contemporary film is now helping to form a mass culture on the global scale, as the youth of foreign nations acquire the American speech, tastes, and attitudes reflected in film.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_092">Jessica C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_p01">With control of over 95 percent of U.S. film production, the big six Hollywood studios—Warner Bros., Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Universal, Columbia, and Disney—are at the forefront of the American film industry, setting the standards for distribution, release, marketing, and production values. However, the high costs of moviemaking today are such that even successful studios must find moneymaking potential in crossover media—computer games, network TV rights, spin-off TV series, DVD and releases on Blu-ray Disc format, toys and other merchandise, books, and other after-market products—to help recoup their losses. The drive for aftermarket marketability in turn dictates the kinds of films studios are willing to invest in.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_094">Steve Hanson and Sandra Garcia-Myers, “Blockbusters,” in <em class="emphasis">St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture</em>, ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s02_s01_p01">In the days of the vertically integrated studio system, filmmaking was a streamlined process, neither as risky nor as expensive as it is today. When producers, directors, screenwriters, art directors, actors, cinematographers, and other technical staff were all under contract with one studio, turnaround time for the casting and production of a film was often as little as 3 to 4 months. Beginning in the 1970s, after the decline of the studio system, the production costs for films increased dramatically, forcing the studios to invest more of their budgets in marketing efforts that could generate <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">presales</a><span class="glossdef">Sales of distribution rights for a film in different sectors before the film’s release.</span></span>—that is, sales of distribution rights for a film in different sectors before the movie’s release.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn08_095">Steve Hanson and Sandra Garcia-Myers, “Blockbusters,” in <em class="emphasis">St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture</em>, ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch08_s03_s03_p01">Movie piracy used to be perpetrated in two ways: Either someone snuck into a theater with a video camera, turning out blurred, wobbly, off-colored copies of the original film, or somebody close to the film leaked a private copy intended for reviewers. In the digital age, however, crystal-clear bootlegs of movies on DVD and the Internet are increasingly likely to appear illegally, posing a much greater threat to a film’s profitability.
