    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_p01">Media theories provide the framework for approaching questions about media effects ranging from as simple as how 10-year-old boys react to cereal advertisements to as broad as how Internet use affects literacy. Once researchers visualize a project and determine a theoretical framework, they must choose actual research methods. Contemporary research methods are greatly varied and can range from analyzing old newspapers to performing controlled experiments.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Content Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Content analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A research method in which the content of media is analyzed.</span></span> is a research technique that involves analyzing the content of various forms of media. Through content analysis, researchers hope to understand both the people who created the content and the people who consumed it. A typical content analysis project does not require elaborate experiments. Instead, it simply requires access to the appropriate media to analyze, making this type of research an easier and inexpensive alternative to other forms of research involving complex surveys or human subjects.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s01_p02">Content analysis studies require researchers to define what types of media to study. For example, researchers studying violence in the media would need to decide which types of media to analyze, such as television, and the types of formats to examine, such as children’s cartoons. The researchers would then need to define the terms used in the study; media violence can be classified according to the characters involved in the violence (strangers, family members, or racial groups), the type of violence (self-inflicted, slapstick, or against others), or the context of the violence (revenge, random, or duty-related). These are just a few of the ways that media violence could be studied with content-analysis techniques.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn02_039">Arthur Asa Berger, <em class="emphasis">Media Research Techniques</em> (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1998), 23–24.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Archival Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p01">Any study that analyzes older media must employ archival research, which is a type of research that focuses on reviewing historical documents such as old newspapers and past publications. Old local newspapers are often available on microfilm at local libraries or at the newspaper offices. University libraries generally provide access to archives of national publications such as <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> or <em class="emphasis">Time</em>; publications can also increasingly be found in online databases or on websites.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p02">Older radio programs are available for free or by paid download through a number of online sources. Many television programs and films have also been made available for free download, or for rent or sale through online distributors. Performing an online search for a particular title will reveal the options available.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s02_p03">Resources such as the Internet Archive (<a class="link" href="http://www.archive.org">www.archive.org</a>) work to archive a number of media sources. One important role of the Internet Archive is website archiving. Internet archives are invaluable for a study of online media because they store websites that have been deleted or changed. These archives have made it possible for Internet content analyses that would have otherwise been impossible.</p>

    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s03" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Surveys</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p01">Surveys are ubiquitous in modern life. Questionaires record data on anything from political preferences to personal hygiene habits. Media surveys generally take one of the following two forms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p02">A descriptive survey aims to find the current state of things, such as public opinion or consumer preferences. In media, descriptive surveys establish television and radio ratings by finding the number of people who watch or listen to particular programs. An analytical survey, however, does more than simply document a current situation. Instead, it attempts to find out why a particular situation exists. Researchers pose questions or hypotheses about media and then conduct analytical surveys to answer these questions. Analytical surveys can determine the relationship between different forms of media consumption and the lifestyles and habits of media consumers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s03_p03">Surveys can employ either open-ended or closed-ended questions. Open-ended questions require the participant to generate answers in their own words, while closed-ended questions force the participant to select an answer from a list. Although open-ended questions allow for a greater variety of answers, the results of closed-ended questions are easier to tabulate. Although surveys are useful in media studies, effective use requires keeping their limitations in mind.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Social Role Analysis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_p01">As part of child rearing, parents teach their children about social roles. When parents prepare children to attend school for example, they explain the basics of school rules and what is expected of a student to help the youngsters understand the role of students. Like the role of a character in a play, this role carries specific expectations that differentiate school from home. Adults often play a number of different roles as they navigate between their responsibilities as parents, employees, friends, and citizens. Any individual may play a number of roles depending on his or her specific life choices.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s04_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Social role analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A reseach method that analyzes the roles that individuals take in the media.</span></span> of the media involves examining various individuals in the media and analyzing the type of role that each plays. Role analysis research can consider the roles of men, women, children, members of a racial minority, or members any other social group in specific types of media. For example, if the role children play in cartoons is consistently different from the role they play in sitcoms, then certain conclusions might be drawn about both of these formats. Analyzing roles used in media allows researchers to gain a better understanding of the messages that the mass media sends.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn02_040">Arthur Asa Berger, <em class="emphasis">Media Research Techniques</em> (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1998), 45–48.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Depth Interviews</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s05_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">depth interview</a><span class="glossdef">A research method in which researchers conduct lengthy interviews with test subjects.</span></span> is an anthropological research tool that is also useful in media studies. Depth interviews take surveys one step further by allowing researchers to directly ask a study participant specific questions to gain a fuller understanding of the participant’s perceptions and experiences. Depth interviews have been used in research projects that follow newspaper reporters to find out their reasons for reporting certain stories and in projects that attempt to understand the motivations for reading romance novels. Depth interviews can provide a deeper understanding of the media consumption habits of particular groups of people.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn02_041">Susanna Hornig Priest, <em class="emphasis">Doing Media Research: An Introduction</em> (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2010), 16–22.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s06_p01"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rhetorical analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A research method that examines the styles used in media.</span></span> involves examining the “styles” used in media and attempting to understand the kinds of messages those styles convey. Media styles refer to form, presentation, composition, use of metaphors, and reasoning structure. Rhetorical analysis reveals the messages not apparent in a strict reading of content. Studies involving rhetorical analysis have focused on media such as advertising to better understand the roles of style and rhetorical devices in media messages.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn02_042">Barrie Gunter, <em class="emphasis">Media Research Methods: Measuring Audiences, Reactions and Impact</em> (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2000), 89.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Focus Groups</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s07_p01">Like depth interviews, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus groups</a><span class="glossdef">A group interview in which participants respond to questions posed about a certain subject.</span></span> allow researchers to better understand public responses to media. Unlike a depth interview, however, a focus group allows the participants to establish a group dynamic that more closely resembles that of normal media consumption. In media studies, researchers can employ focus groups to judge the reactions of a group to specific media styles and to content. This can be a valuable means of understanding the reasons for consuming specific types of media.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Experiments</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s08_p01">Media research studies also sometimes use controlled experiments that expose a test group to an experience involving media and measure the effects of that experience. Researchers then compare these measurements to those of a control group that had key elements of the experience removed. For example, reseachers may show one group of children a program with three incidents of cartoon violence and another control group of similar children the same program without the violent incidents. Researchers then ask the children from both groups the same sets of questions, and the results are compared.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Participant Observation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s09_p01">In <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">participant observation</a><span class="glossdef">A research method in which researchers try to become a part of the groups they are studying.</span></span>, researchers try to become part of the group they are studying. Although this technique is typically associated with anthropological studies in which a researcher lives with members of a particular culture to gain a deeper understanding of their values and lives, it is also used in media research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s09_p02">Media consumption often takes place in groups. Families or friends gather to watch favorite programs, children may watch Saturday morning cartoons with a group of their peers, and adults may host viewing parties for televised sporting events or awards shows. These groups reveal insights into the role of media in the lives of the public. A researcher might join a group that watches football together and stay with the group for an entire season. By becoming a part of the group, the researcher becomes part of the experiment and can reveal important influences of media on culture.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn02_043">Susanna Hornig Priest, <em class="emphasis">Doing Media Research: An Introduction</em> (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2010), 96–98.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch02_s03_s09_p03">Researchers have studied online role-playing games, such as <em class="emphasis">World of Warcraft</em>, in this manner. These games reveal an interesting aspect of group dynamics: Although participants are not in physical proximity, they function as a group within the game. Researchers are able to study these games by playing them. In the book <em class="emphasis">Digital Culture, Play, and Identity: A World of Warcraft Reader</em>, a group of researchers discussed the results of their participant observation studies. The studies reveal the surprising depth of culture and unwritten rules that exist in the World of Warcraft universe and give important interpretations of why players pursue the game with such dedication.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn02_044">Hilde Corneliussen and Jill Walker Rettberg, “Introduction: ‘Orc ProfessorLFG,’ or Researching in Azeroth,” in <em class="emphasis">Digital Culture, Play, and Identity: A World of Warcraft Reader</em>, ed.
