    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_p01">Location, readership, political climate, and competition all contribute to rapid transformations in journalistic models and writing styles. Over time, however, certain styles—such as sensationalism—have faded or become linked with less serious publications, like tabloids, while others have developed to become prevalent in modern-day reporting. This section explores the nuanced differences among the most commonly used models of journalism.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Objective versus Story-Driven Journalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p01">In the late 1800s, a majority of publishers believed that they would sell more papers by reaching out to specific groups. As such, most major newspapers employed a partisan approach to writing, churning out political stories and using news to sway popular opinion. This all changed in 1896 when a then-failing paper, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, took a radical new approach to reporting: employing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">objectivity</a><span class="glossdef">Impartiality in writing.</span></span>, or impartiality, to satisfy a wide range of readers.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Rise of Objective Journalism</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p01">At the end of the 19th century, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> found itself competing with the papers of Pulitzer and Hearst. The paper’s publishers discovered that it was nearly impossible to stay afloat without using the sensationalist headlines popularized by its competitors. Although <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> publishers raised prices to pay the bills, the higher charge led to declining readership, and soon the paper went bankrupt. Adolph Ochs, owner of the once-failing <em class="emphasis">Chattanooga Times</em>, took a gamble and bought <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> in 1896. On August 18 of that year, Ochs made a bold move and announced that the paper would no longer follow the sensationalist style that made Pulitzer and Hearst famous, but instead would be “clean, dignified, trustworthy and impartial.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_021">“Adolph S. Ochs Dead at 77; Publisher of Times Since 1896,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, April 9, 1935, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0312.html">http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0312.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s01_p02">This drastic change proved to be a success. <em class="emphasis">T</em>he <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em> became the first of many papers to demonstrate that the press could be “economically as well as ethically successful.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_022">“Adolph S. Ochs Dead at 77; Publisher of Times Since 1896,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, April 9, 1935, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0312.html">http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0312.html</a>.</span> With the help of managing editor Carr Van Anda, the new motto “All the News That’s Fit to Print,” and lowered prices, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> quickly turned into one of the most profitable impartial papers of all time. Since the newspaper’s successful turnaround, publications around the world have followed <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>’ objective journalistic style, demanding that reporters maintain a neutral voice in their writing.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Inverted Pyramid Style</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p01">One commonly employed technique in modern journalism is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inverted pyramid style</a><span class="glossdef">A journalistic style in which the most important information is placed in the lead paragraph, with additional information appearing in order of importance.</span></span>. This style requires objectivity and involves structuring a story so that the most important details are listed first for ease of reading. In the inverted pyramid format, the most fundamental facts of a story—typically the who, what, when, where, and why—appear at the top in the lead paragraph, with nonessential information in subsequent paragraphs. The style arose as a product of the telegraph. The inverted pyramid proved useful when telegraph connections failed in the middle of transmission; the editor still had the most important information at the beginning. Similarly, editors could quickly delete content from the bottom up to meet time and space requirements.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_023">Chip Scanlan, “Writing from the Top Down: Pros and Cons of the Inverted Pyramid,” Poynter, June 20, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/newsgathering-storytelling/chip-on-your-shoulder/12754/writing-from-the-top-down-pros-and-cons-of-the-inverted-pyramid/">http://www.poynter.org/how-tos/newsgathering-storytelling/chip-on-your-shoulder/12754/writing-from-the-top-down-pros-and-cons-of-the-inverted-pyramid/</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_s02_p02">The reason for such writing is threefold. First, the style is helpful for writers, as this type of reporting is somewhat easier to complete in the short deadlines imposed on journalists, particularly in today’s fast-paced news business. Second, the style benefits editors who can, if necessary, quickly cut the story from the bottom without losing vital information. Finally, the style keeps in mind traditional readers, most of who skim articles or only read a few paragraphs, but they can still learn most of the important information from this quick read.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Interpretive Journalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p01">During the 1920s, objective journalism fell under critique as the world became more complex. Even though <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> continued to thrive, readers craved more than dry, objective stories. In 1923, <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine launched as the first major publication to step away from simple objectivity to try to provide readers with a more analytical interpretation of the news. As <em class="emphasis">Time</em> grew, people at some other publications took notice, and slowly editors began rethinking how they might reach out to readers in an increasingly interrelated world.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p02">During the 1930s, two major events increased the desire for a new style of journalism: the Great Depression and the Nazi threat to global stability. Readers were no longer content with the who, what, where, when, and why of objective journalism. Instead, they craved analysis and a deeper explanation of the chaos surrounding them. Many papers responded with a new type of reporting that became known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">interpretive journalism</a><span class="glossdef">A style of writing that goes beyond providing basic facts to include context and analysis of an event or issue.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p03">Interpretive journalism, following <em class="emphasis">Time</em>’s example, has grown in popularity since its inception in the 1920s and 1930s, and journalists use it to explain issues and to provide readers with a broader context for the stories that they encounter. According to Brant Houston, the executive director of Investigative Reporters and Editors Inc., an interpretive journalist “goes beyond the basic facts of an event or topic to provide context, analysis, and possible consequences.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_024">Brant Houston, “Interpretive Journalism,” <em class="emphasis">The International Encyclopedia of Communication</em>, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g978140513199514_ss82-1">http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405131995_chunk_g978140513199514_ss82-1</a>.</span> When this new style was first used, readers responded with great interest to the new editorial perspectives that newspapers were offering on events. But interpretive journalism posed a new problem for editors: the need to separate straight objective news from opinions and analysis. In response, many papers in the 1930s and 1940s “introduced weekend interpretations of the past week’s events … and interpretive columnists with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bylines</a><span class="glossdef">The credit line identifying the author of the article.</span></span>.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_025">Stephen J. A. Ward, “Journalism Ethics,” in <em class="emphasis">The Handbook of Journalism Studies</em>, ed. Karin Wahl-Jorgensen and Thomas Hanitzsch (New York: Routledge, 2008): 298.</span> As explained by Stephen J. A. Ward in his article, “Journalism Ethics,” the goal of these weekend features was to “supplement objective reporting with an informed interpretation of world events.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_026">Stephen J.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Competition From Broadcasting</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s01_p01">The 1930s also saw the rise of broadcasting as radios became common in most U.S. households and as sound–picture recordings for newsreels became increasingly common. This broadcasting revolution introduced new dimensions to journalism. Scholar Michael Schudson has noted that broadcast news “reflect[ed] … a new journalistic reality. The journalist, no longer merely the relayer of documents and messages, ha[d] become the interpreter of the news.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_027">Michael Schudson, “The Politics of Narrative Form: The Emergence of News Conventions in Print and Television,” in “Print Culture and Video Culture,” <em class="emphasis">Daedalus</em> 111, no. 4 (1982): 104.</span> However, just as radio furthered the interpretive journalistic style, it also created a new problem for print journalism, particularly newspapers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s01_p02">Suddenly, free news from the radio offered competition to the pay news of newspapers. Scholar Robert W. McChesney has observed that, in the 1930s, “many elements of the newspaper industry opposed commercial broadcasting, often out of fear of losing ad revenues and circulation to the broadcasters.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_028">Robert W. McChesney, “Media and Democracy: The Emergence of Commercial Broadcasting in the United States, 1927–1935,” in “Communication in History: The Key to Understanding” <em class="emphasis">OAH Magazine of History</em> 6, no. 4 (1992): 37.</span> This fear led to a media war as papers claimed that radio was stealing their print stories. Radio outlets, however, believed they had equal right to news stories. According to Robert W. McChesney, “commercial broadcasters located their industry next to the newspaper industry as an icon of American freedom and culture.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_029">Robert W. McChesney, “Media and Democracy: The Emergence of Commercial Broadcasting in the United States, 1927–1935,” in “Communication in History: The Key to Understanding” <em class="emphasis">OAH Magazine of History</em> 6, no. 4 (1992): 38.</span> The debate had a major effect on interpretive journalism as radio and newspapers had to make decisions about whether to use an objective or interpretive format to remain competitive with each other.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_s01_p03">The emergence of television during the 1950s created even more competition for newspapers. In response, paper publishers increased opinion-based articles, and many added what became known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">op-ed</a><span class="glossdef">An abbreviation of <em class="emphasis">opposite the editorial page</em>. An op-ed is an article written by an unaffliated journalist that expresses opinions.</span></span> pages. An op-ed page—short for <em class="emphasis">opposite the editorial page</em>—features opinion-based columns typically produced by a writer or writers unaffiliated with the paper’s editorial board. As op-ed pages grew, so did interpretive journalism. Distinct from news stories, editors and columnists presented opinions on a regularly basis. By the 1960s, the interpretive style of reporting had begun to replace the older descriptive style.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_030">Thomas Patterson, “Why Is News So Negative These Days?” <em class="emphasis">History News Network</em>, 2002, <a class="link" href="http://hnn.us/articles/1134.html">http://hnn.us/articles/1134.html</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Literary Journalism</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_p01">Stemming from the development of interpretive journalism, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">literary journalism</a><span class="glossdef">A style of journalism that combines journalistic and fictional styles.</span></span> began to emerge during the 1960s. This style, made popular by journalists Tom Wolfe (formerly a strictly nonfiction writer) and Truman Capote, is often referred to as <em class="emphasis">New Journalism</em> and combines factual reporting with sometimes fictional narration. Literary journalism follows neither the formulaic style of reporting of objective journalism nor the opinion-based analytical style of interpretive journalism. Instead, this art form—as it is often termed—brings voice and character to historical events, focusing on the construction of the scene rather than on the retelling of the facts.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s01_p01">Tom Wolfe was the first reporter to write in the literary journalistic style. In 1963, while his newspaper, New York’s <em class="emphasis">Herald Tribune</em>, was on strike, <em class="emphasis">Esquire</em> magazine hired Wolfe to write an article on customized cars. Wolfe gathered the facts but struggled to turn his collected information into a written piece. His managing editor, Byron Dobell, suggested that he type up his notes so that <em class="emphasis">Esquire</em> could hire another writer to complete the article. Wolfe typed up a 49-page document that described his research and what he wanted to include in the story and sent it to Dobell. Dobell was so impressed by this piece that he simply deleted the “Dear Byron” at the top of the letter and published the rest of Wolfe’s letter in its entirety under the headline “There Goes (Varoom! Varoom!) That Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby.” The article was a great success, and Wolfe, in time, became known as the father of new journalism. When he later returned to work at the <em class="emphasis">Herald Tribune</em>, Wolfe brought with him this new style, “fusing the stylistic features of fiction and the reportorial obligations of journalism.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_031">Richard A. Kallan, “Tom Wolfe,” in <em class="emphasis">A Sourcebook of American Literary Journalism: Representative Writers in an Emerging Genre</em>, ed. Thomas B.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s01_p02">Truman Capote responded to Wolfe’s new style by writing <em class="emphasis">In Cold Blood</em>, which Capote termed a “nonfiction novel,” in 1966.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_032">George Plimpton, “The Story Behind a Nonfiction Novel,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 16, 1966, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/12/28/home/capote-interview.html">http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/12/28/home/capote-interview.html</a>.</span> The tale of an actual murder that had taken place on a Kansas farm some years earlier, the novel was based on numerous interviews and painstaking research.

            <h2 class="title editable block">The Effects of Literary Journalism</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_p01">Although literary journalism certainly affected newspaper reporting styles, it had a much greater impact on the magazine industry. Because they were bound by fewer restrictions on length and deadlines, magazines were more likely to publish this new writing style than were newspapers. Indeed, during the 1960s and 1970s, authors simulating the styles of both Wolfe and Capote flooded magazines such as <em class="emphasis">Esquire</em> and <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em> with articles.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s02_p02">Literary journalism also significantly influenced objective journalism. Many literary journalists believed that objectivity limited their ability to critique a story or a writer. Some claimed that objectivity in writing is impossible, as all journalists are somehow swayed by their own personal histories. Still others, including Wolfe, argued that objective journalism conveyed a “limited conception of the ‘facts,’” which “often effected an inaccurate, incomplete story that precluded readers from exercising informed judgment.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_036">Richard A.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s03_p01">The reactions of literary journalists to objective journalism encouraged the growth of two more types of journalism: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">advocacy journalism</a><span class="glossdef">A style of journalism that expresses a biased position to generate support for a cause.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">precision journalism</a><span class="glossdef">A style of journalism that employs social and behavioral science and research.</span></span>. Advocacy journalists promote a particular cause and intentionally adopt a biased, nonobjective viewpoint to do so effectively. However, serious advocate journalists adhere to strict guidelines, as “an advocate journalist is not the same as being an activist” according to journalist Sue Careless.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_037">Sue Careless, “Advocacy Journalism,” <em class="emphasis">Interim</em>, May 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.theinterim.com/2000/may/10advocacy.html">http://www.theinterim.com/2000/may/10advocacy.html</a>.</span> In an article discussing advocacy journalism, Careless contrasted the role of an advocate journalist with the role of an activist.

                <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s03_p02">A journalist writing for the advocacy press should practice the same skills as any journalist. You don’t fabricate or falsify. If you do you will destroy the credibility of both yourself as a working journalist and the cause you care so much about. News should never be propaganda.

In 2007, <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> reporter Peter Johnson stated, “[i]ncreasingly, journalists and talk-show hosts want to ‘own’ a niche issue or problem, find ways to solve it, and be associated with making this world a better place.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_039">Peter Johnson, “More Reporters Embrace an Advocacy Role,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, March 5, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-03-05-social-journalism_N.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-03-05-social-journalism_N.htm</a>.</span> In this manner, journalists across the world are employing the advocacy style to highlight issues they care about.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Oprah Winfrey: Advocacy Journalist</h3>
                <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s03_p04">Television talk-show host and owner of production company Harpo Inc., Oprah Winfrey is one of the most successful, recognizable entrepreneurs of the late-20th and early-21st centuries. Winfrey has long been a news reporter, beginning in the late 1970s as a coanchor of an evening television program. She began hosting her own show in 1984, and as of 2010, the <em class="emphasis">Oprah Winfrey Show</em> is one of the most popular television programs on the air. Winfrey has long used her show as a platform for issues and concerns, making her one of today’s most famous advocacy journalists. While many praise Winfrey for using her celebrity to draw attention to causes she cares about, others criticize her techniques, claiming that she uses the advocacy style for self-promotion. As one critic writes, “I’m not sure how Oprah’s endless self-promotion of how she spent millions on a school in South Africa suddenly makes her ‘own’ the ‘education niche.’ She does own the trumpet-my-own-horn niche. But that’s not ‘journalism.’”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_040">Debbie Schlussel, “USA Today Heralds ‘Oprah Journalism,’” <em class="emphasis">Debbie Schlussel</em> (blog), March 6, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.debbieschlussel.com/497/usa-today-heralds-oprah-journalism/">http://www.debbieschlussel.com/497/usa-today-heralds-oprah-journalism/</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s03_p05">Yet despite this somewhat harsh critique, many view Winfrey as the leading example of positive advocacy journalism. Sara Grumbles claims in her blog “Breaking and Fitting the Mold”: “Oprah Winfrey obviously practices advocacy journalism…. Winfrey does not fit the mold of a ‘typical’ journalist by today’s standards. She has an agenda and she voices her opinions. She has her own op-ed page in the form of a million dollar television studio. Objectivity is not her strong point. Still, in my opinion she is a journalist.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_041">Sara Grumbles, “Breaking and Fitting the Mold,” <em class="emphasis">Media Chatter</em> (blog), October 3, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.commajor.com/?p=1244">http://www.commajor.com/?p=1244</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s03_p06">Regardless of the arguments about the value and reasoning underlying her technique, Winfrey unquestionably practices a form of advocacy journalism. In fact, thanks to her vast popularity, she may be the most compelling example of an advocacy journalist working today.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_s03_p07">Precision journalism emerged in the 1970s. In this form, journalists turn to polls and studies to strengthen the accuracy of their articles. Philip Meyer, commonly acknowledged as the father of precision journalism, says that his intent is to “encourage my colleagues in journalism to apply the principles of scientific method to their tasks of gathering and presenting the news.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_042">Philip Meyer, <em class="emphasis">Precision Journalism: A Reporter’s Introduction to Social Science Methods</em>, 4th ed. (Oxford: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2002), vii.</span> This type of journalism adds a new layer to objectivity in reporting, as articles no longer need to rely solely on anecdotal evidence; journalists can employ hard facts and figures to support their assertions. An example of precision journalism would be an article on voting patterns in a presidential election that cites data from exit polls. Precision journalism has become more popular as computers have become more prevalent. Many journalists currently use this type of writing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Consensus versus Conflict Newspapers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p01">Another important distinction within the field of journalism must be made between <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consensus journalism</a><span class="glossdef">A style of journalism in which papers promote social and economic harmony, by focusing on shared, often local, issues.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conflict journalism</a><span class="glossdef">A style of journalism that focuses on events, issues, or experiences outside of the social norm.</span></span>. Consensus journalism typically takes place in smaller communities, where local newspapers generally serve as a forum for many different voices. Newspapers that use consensus-style journalism provide community calendars and meeting notices and run articles on local schools, events, government, property crimes, and zoning. These newspapers can help build civic awareness and a sense of shared experience and responsibility among readers in a community. Often, business or political leaders in the community own consensus papers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p02">Conversely, conflict journalism, like that which is presented in national and international news articles in <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, typically occurs in national or metropolitan dailies. Conflict journalists define news in terms of societal discord, covering events and issues that contravene perceived social norms. In this style of journalism, reporters act as watchdogs who monitor the government and its activities. Conflict journalists often present both sides of a story and pit ideas against one another to generate conflict and, therefore, attract a larger readership. Both conflict and consensus papers are widespread. However, because they serve different purposes and reach out to differing audiences, they largely do not compete with each other.</p>

These publications, which reach out to a specific target group, are rising in popularity in the era of Internet. As Robert Courtemanche, a certified journalism educator, writes, “[i]n the past, newspapers tried to be everything to every reader to gain circulation. That outdated concept does not work on the Internet where readers expect expert, niche content.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_043">Robert Courtemanche, “Newspapers Must Find Their Niche to Survive,” <a class="link" href="http://Suite101.com">Suite101.com</a>, December 20, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://newspaperindustry.suite101.com/article.cfm/newspapers_must_find_their_niche_to_survive">http://newspaperindustry.suite101.com/article.cfm/newspapers_must_find_their_niche_to_survive</a>.</span> Ethnic and minority papers are some of the most common forms of niche newspapers. In the United States—particularly in large cities such as New York—niche papers for numerous ethnic communities flourish. Some common types of U.S. niche papers are papers that cater to a specific ethnic or cultural group or to a group that speaks a particular language. Papers that cover issues affecting lesbians, gay men, and bisexual individuals—like the <em class="emphasis">Advocate</em>—and religion-oriented publications—like <em class="emphasis">The Christian Science Monitor</em>—are also niche papers.</p>

Popularized in the 1960s and 1970s as individuals sought to publish articles documenting their perception of social tensions and inequalities, the underground press typically caters to alternative and countercultural groups. Most of these papers are published on small budgets. Perhaps the most famous underground paper is New York’s Pulitzer Prize–winning <em class="emphasis">Village Voice</em>. This newspaper was founded in 1955 and declares its role in the publishing industry by saying:</p>

By offering an alternative perspective to stories and by reaching out to niche groups through their writing, underground-press newspapers fill a unique need within the larger media marketplace. As journalism has evolved over the years, newspapers have adapted to serve the changing demands of readers.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_s01_l01" mark="bullet">
                    <li>Objective journalism began as a response to sensationalism and has continued in some form to this day. However, some media observers have argued that it is nearly impossible to remain entirely objective while reporting a story. One argument against objectivity is that journalists are human and are, therefore, biased to some degree. Many newspapers that promote objectivity put in place systems to help their journalists remain as objective as possible.</li>
                    <li>Literary journalism combines the research and reporting of typical newspaper journalism with the writing style of fiction. While most newspaper journalists focus on facts, literary journalists tend to focus on the scene by evoking voices and characters inhabiting historical events. Famous early literary journalists include Tom Wolfe and Truman Capote.</li>
                    <li>Other journalistic styles allow reporters and publications to narrow their editorial voice. Advocacy journalists encourage readers to support a particular cause. Consensus journalism encourages social and economic harmony, while conflict journalists present information in a way that focuses on views outside of the social norm.</li>
                    <li>Niche newspapers—such as members of the underground press and those serving specific ethnic groups, racial groups, or speakers of a specific language—serve as important media outlets for distinct voices. The rise of the Internet and online journalism has brought niche newspapers more into the mainstream.</li>
