Although the paper does not formally publish on weekends, it does have a partner paper titled <em class="emphasis">USA Weekend</em>. <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em> consists of four sections: news, money, sports, and life; for the ease of its readers, the newspaper color-codes each section. Owned by the Gannett Company, the paper caters to its audience by opting for ease of comprehension over complexity.</p>

An international paper that focuses on business and financial news, <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em> primarily uses written narration with few images. Recent changes to its layout, such as adding advertising on the front page and minimizing the size of the paper slightly to save on printing costs, have not dramatically shifted this long-standing focus. The paper runs between 50 and 96 pages per issue and gives its readers up-to-date information on the economy, business, and national and international financial news.</p>

This weekend supplement section focused on entertainment and lifestyle issues, like style, food, and fashion.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_p01">Despite major newspapers’ large circulations, newspapers as a whole are experiencing a dramatic decline in both subscribers and overall readership. For example, on February 27, 2009, Denver’s <em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em> published its final issue after nearly 150 years in print. The front-page article “Goodbye, Colorado” reflected on the paper’s long-standing history with the Denver community, observing that “It is with great sadness that we say goodbye to you today. Our time chronicling the life of Denver and Colorado, the nation and the world, is over.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_064"><em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em>, “Goodbye, Colorado,” February 7, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/feb/27/goodbye-colorado/">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/feb/27/goodbye-colorado/</a>.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Readership Decline</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p01">The story of <em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em> is neither unique nor entirely unexpected. For nearly a half-century, predictions of the disappearance of print newspapers have been an ongoing refrain. The fear of losing print media began in the 1940s with the arrival of the radio and television. Indeed, the number of daily papers has steadily decreased since the 1940s; in 1990, the number of U.S. dailies was just 1,611. By 2008, that number had further shrunk to 1,408.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_065">Newspaper Association of American, “Total Paid Circulation,” <a class="link" href="http://www.naa.org/TrendsandNumbers/Total-Paid-Circulation.aspx">http://www.naa.org/TrendsandNumbers/Total-Paid-Circulation.aspx</a>.</span> But the numbers are not as clear-cut as they appear. As one report observed, “The root problems go back to the late 1940s, when the percentage of Americans reading newspapers began to drop. But for years the U.S. population was growing so much that circulation kept rising and then, after 1970s, remained stable.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_066">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Newspapers: Audience” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_audience.asp?cat=3&amp;media=2">http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_audience.asp?cat=3&amp;media=2</a>.</span> During the 1970s when circulation stopped rising, more women were entering the workforce. By the 1990s when “circulation began to decline in absolute numbers,” the number of women in the workforce was higher than had ever been previously experienced.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_067">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Newspapers: Audience” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_audience.asp?cat=3&amp;media=2">http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_audience.asp?cat=3&amp;media=2</a>.</span> With women at work, there were fewer people at home with leisure time for reading daily papers for their news. This, combined with television journalism’s rising popularity and the emergence of the Internet, meant a significant decrease in newspaper circulation. With newer, more immediate ways to get news, the disconnect between newspapers and consumers deepened.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p02">Compounding the problem is newspapers’ continuing struggle to attract younger readers. Many of these young readers simply did not grow up in households that subscribed to daily papers and so they do not turn to newspapers for information. However, the problem seems to be more complex “than fewer people developing the newspaper habit. People who used to read every day now read less often. Some people who used to read a newspaper have stopped altogether.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_068">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Newspapers: Audience” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_audience.asp?cat=3&amp;media=2">http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/narrative_newspapers_audience.asp?cat=3&amp;media=2</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p03">Yet the most significant challenge to newspapers is certainly the Internet. As print readership declines, online readership has grown; fast, free access to breaking information contributes to the growing appeal of online news. Despite the increase in online news readers, that growth has not offset the drop in print readership. In 2008, the Pew Research Center conducted a news media consumption survey in which only</p>
            <span class="blockquote block">
                <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p04">39 percent of participants claimed to having read a newspaper (either print or online) the day before, showing a drop from 43 percent in 2006. Meanwhile, readership of print newspapers fell from 34 percent to 25 percent in that time period.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_069">Emily Dilling, “Study: Newspaper Readership Down, Despite Online Increase,” <em class="emphasis">Shaping the Future of the Newspaper</em> (blog), March 3, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.sfnblog.com/circulation_and_readership/2009/03/study_newspaper_readership_down_despite.php">http://www.sfnblog.com/circulation_and_readership/2009/03/study_newspaper_readership_down_despite.php</a>.</span></p>
            </span>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_s01_p05">The study also observed that younger generations are primarily responsible for this shift to online reading. “The changes in reader habits seem to be similar amongst both Generation X and Y demographics, where marked increases in consulting online news sources were observed.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_070">Emily Dilling, “Study: Newspaper Readership Down, Despite Online Increase,” <em class="emphasis">Shaping the Future of the Newspaper</em> (blog), March 3, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.sfnblog.com/circulation_and_readership/2009/03/study_newspaper_readership_down_despite.php">http://www.sfnblog.com/circulation_and_readership/2009/03/study_newspaper_readership_down_despite.php</a>.</span> Baby boomers and older generations do, for the most part, still rely on printed newspapers for information. Perhaps this distinction between generations is not surprising. Younger readers grew up with the Internet and have developed different expectations about the speed, nature, and cost of information than have older generations. However, this trend suggests that online readership along with the general decline of news readers may make printed newspapers all but obsolete in the near future.</p>

The implementation of JOAs means that two newspapers could “share the cost of business, advertising, and circulation operations,” which helped newspapers stay afloat in the face of an ever-shrinking readership.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_071">David Milstead, “Newspaper Joint Operating Agreements Are Fading,” <em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em>, January 22, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/22/newspaper-joas-fading/">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/22/newspaper-joas-fading/</a>.</span> The Newspaper Preservation Act also ensured that two competing papers could keep their distinct news divisions but merge their business divisions.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s02_s02_p02">At its peak, 28 newspaper JOAs existed across the United States, but as the industry declines at an increasingly rapid rate, JOAs are beginning to fail. With today’s shrinking pool of readers, two newspapers simply cannot effectively function in one community. In 2009, only nine JOAs continued operations, largely because JOAs “don’t eliminate the basic problem of one newspaper gaining the upper hand in circulation and, hence, advertising revenue.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_072">David Milstead, “Newspaper Joint Operating Agreements Are Fading,” <em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em>, January 22, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/22/newspaper-joas-fading/">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/22/newspaper-joas-fading/</a>.</span> With advertising playing a key role in newspapers’ financial survival, revenue loss is a critical blow. Additionally, “in recent years, of course, the Internet has thrown an even more dramatic wrench into the equation. Classified advertising has migrated to Internet sites like <a class="link" href="http://craigslist.org">craigslist.org</a> while traditional retail advertisers … can advertise via their own websites.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_073">David Milstead, “Newspaper Joint Operating Agreements Are Fading,” <em class="emphasis">Rocky Mountain News</em>, January 22, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/22/newspaper-joas-fading/">http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2009/jan/22/newspaper-joas-fading/</a>.</span> As more advertisers move away from the newspaper industry, more JOAs will likely crumble.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s03_p01">As newspapers diminish in number and as newspaper owners find themselves in financial trouble, a dramatic increase in the consolidation of newspaper ownership has taken place.

The change has been occurring for some time; in fact, “since 1975, more than two-thirds of independently owned newspapers … have disappeared.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_074">Free Press, “Media Consolidation,” <a class="link" href="http://www.freepress.net/policy/ownership/consolidation">http://www.freepress.net/policy/ownership/consolidation</a>.</span> However, since 2000, newspaper consolidation has increased markedly as more papers are turning over control to larger companies.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s03_p03">Among the 22 companies that own the largest percentage of the papers, four chains stand out: Gannett, the Tribune Company, the New York Times Company, and the McClatchy Company. Not only do these companies each own several papers across the country, but they also enjoy a higher-than-normal profit margin relative to smaller chains.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p01">In addition to consolidation, the decline of print newspapers has brought about several changes in ownership as companies attempt to increase their revenue. In 2007, media mogul Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation purchased <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em> with an unsolicited $5 billion bid, promising to “pour money into the <em class="emphasis">Journal</em> and its website and use his satellite television networks in Europe and Asia to spread <em class="emphasis">Journal</em> content the world over.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_076">Frank Ahrens, “Murdoch Seizes Wall St. Journal in $5 Billion Coup,” <em class="emphasis">Washington Post</em>, August 1, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073100896.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073100896.html</a>.</span> Murdoch has used the buyout to move the paper into the technological world, asking readers and newspapers to embrace change. In 2009, he published an article in <em class="emphasis">The Wall Street Journal</em> assuring his readers that “the future of journalism is more promising than ever—limited only by editors and producers unwilling to fight for their readers and viewers, or government using its heavy hand either to overregulate or subsidize us.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_077">Rupert Murdoch, “Journalism and Freedom,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, December 8, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704107104574570191223415268.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704107104574570191223415268.html</a>.</span> Murdoch believes that the hope of journalism lies in embracing the changing world and how its inhabitants receive news. Time will tell if he is correct.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p02">Despite changes in power, the consolidation trend is leveling off. Even large chains must cut costs to avoid shuttering papers entirely. In January 2009, the newspaper industry experienced 2,252 layoffs; in total, the U.S. newspaper industry lost 15,114 jobs that year.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_078">Rupert Murdoch, “Journalism and Freedom,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, December 8, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704107104574570191223415268.html">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704107104574570191223415268.html</a>.</span> With the dual challenges of layoffs and decreasing readership, some in the journalism industry are beginning to explore other options for ownership, such as nonprofit ownership. As one article in the <em class="emphasis">Chronicle of Philanthropy</em> puts it, “[i]t may be time for a more radical reinvention of the daily newspaper. The answer for some newspapers may be to adopt a nonprofit ownership structure that will enable them to seek philanthropic contributions and benefit from tax exemptions.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn04_079">Vince Stehle, “It’s Time for Newspapers to Become Nonprofit Organizations,” <em class="emphasis">Chronicle of Philanthropy</em>, March 12, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://gfem.org/node/492">http://gfem.org/node/492</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch04_s04_s03_s01_p03">It is clear that the newspaper industry is on the brink of major change. Over the next several years, the industry will likely continue to experience a complete upheaval brought on by dwindling readership and major shifts in how individuals consume news. As newspapers scramble to find their footing in an ever-changing business, readers adapt and seek out trustworthy information in new ways.</p>
