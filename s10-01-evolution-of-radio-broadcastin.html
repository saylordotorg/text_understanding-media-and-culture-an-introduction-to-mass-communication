        <h2 class="title editable block">The Invention of Radio</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p01">Guglielmo Marconi is often credited as the inventor of radio. As a young man living in Italy, Marconi read a biography of Hienrich Hertz, who had written and experimented with early forms of wireless transmission. Marconi then duplicated Hertz’s experiments in his own home, successfully sending transmissions from one side of his attic to the other.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_007">“Guglielmo Marconi,” <em class="emphasis">American Experience: People &amp; Events</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rescue/peopleevents/pandeAMEX98.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/rescue/peopleevents/pandeAMEX98.html</a>.</span> He saw the potential for the technology and approached the Italian government for support. When the government showed no interest in his ideas, Marconi moved to England and took out a patent on his device. Rather than inventing radio from scratch, however, Marconi essentially combined the ideas and experiments of other people to make them into a useful communications tool. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_008">Lewis Coe, <em class="emphasis">Wireless Radio: A Brief History</em> (Jefferson, NC: MacFarland, 1996), 4–10.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p02">In fact, long-distance electronic communication has existed since the middle of the 19th century. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">telegraph</a><span class="glossdef">Early communication technology that used wires to transmit messages through a series of clicks.</span></span> communicated messages through a series of long and short clicks. Cables across the Atlantic Ocean connected even the far-distant United States and England using this technology. By the 1870s, telegraph technology had been used to develop the telephone, which could transmit an individual’s voice over the same cables used by its predecessor.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_p03">When Marconi popularized wireless technology, contemporaries initially viewed it as a way to allow the telegraph to function in places that could not be connected by cables. Early radios acted as devices for naval ships to communicate with other ships and with land stations; the focus was on person-to-person communication. However, the potential for broadcasting—sending messages to a large group of potential listeners—wasn’t realized until later in the development of the medium.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Broadcasting Arrives</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p01">The technology needed to build a radio transmitter and receiver was relatively simple, and the knowledge to build such devices soon reached the public. Amateur radio operators quickly crowded the airwaves, broadcasting messages to anyone within range and, by 1912, incurred government regulatory measures that required licenses and limited broadcast ranges for radio operation.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_009">Thomas White, “Pioneering Amateurs (1900–1917),” <em class="emphasis">United States Early Radio History</em>, <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec012.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec012.htm</a>.</span> This regulation also gave the president the power to shut down all stations, a power notably exercised in 1917 upon the United States’ entry into World War I to keep amateur radio operators from interfering with military use of radio waves for the duration of the war.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_010">Thomas White, “Pioneering Amateurs (1900–1917),” <em class="emphasis">United States Early Radio History</em>, <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec012.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec012.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p02">Wireless technology made radio as it is known today possible, but its modern, practical function as a mass communication medium had been the domain of other technologies for some time. As early as the 1880s, people relied on telephones to transmit news, music, church sermons, and weather reports. In Budapest, Hungary, for example, a subscription service allowed individuals to listen to news reports and fictional stories on their telephones.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_011">White, “News and Entertainment by Telephone (1876–1925),” <em class="emphasis">United States Early Radio History</em>, <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec003.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec003.htm</a>.</span> Around this time, telephones also transmitted opera performances from Paris to London. In 1909, this innovation emerged in the United States as a pay-per-play phonograph service in Wilmington, Delaware.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_012">White, “News and Entertainment by Telephone (1876–1925),” <em class="emphasis">United States Early Radio History</em>, <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec003.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec003.htm</a>.</span> This service allowed subscribers to listen to specific music recordings on their telephones.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_013">White, “News and Entertainment by Telephone (1876–1925),” <em class="emphasis">United States Early Radio History</em>, <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec003.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec003.htm</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s01_s01_p03">In 1906, Massachusetts resident Reginald Fessenden initiated the first radio transmission of the human voice, but his efforts did not develop into a useful application.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_014">John Grant, Experiments and Results in Wireless Telegraphy (reprinted from <em class="emphasis">The American Telephone Journal</em>, 49–51, January 26, 1907), <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/1907fes.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/1907fes.htm</a>.</span> Ten years later, Lee de Forest used radio in a more modern sense when he set up an experimental radio station, 2XG, in New York City. De Forest gave nightly broadcasts of music and news until World War I halted all transmissions for private citizens.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_015">White, “Pre-War Vacuum Tube Transmitter Development 1914–1917),” <em class="emphasis">United States Early Radio History</em>, <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec011.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec011.htm</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Radio’s Commercial Potential</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p01">After the World War I radio ban lifted with the close of the conflict in 1919, a number of small stations began operating using technologies that had developed during the war. Many of these stations developed regular programming that included religious sermons, sports, and news.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_016">White, “Broadcasting After World War I (1919–1921),” <em class="emphasis">United States Early Radio History</em>, <a class="link" href="http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec016.htm">http://earlyradiohistory.us/sec016.htm</a>.</span> As early as 1922, Schenectady, New York’s WGY broadcast over 40 original dramas, showing radio’s potential as a medium for drama. The WGY players created their own scripts and performed them live on air. This same groundbreaking group also made the first known attempt at television drama in 1928.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_017">Elizabeth McLeod, “The WGY Players and the Birth of Radio Drama,” 1998, <a class="link" href="http://www.midcoast.com/~lizmcl/wgy.html">http://www.midcoast.com/~lizmcl/wgy.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_p02">Businesses such as department stores, which often had their own stations, first put radio’s commercial applications to use. However, these stations did not advertise in a way that the modern radio listener would recognize. Early radio advertisements consisted only of a “genteel sales message broadcast during ‘business’ (daytime) hours, with no hard sell or mention of price.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_018">Christopher Sterling and John Kittross, <em class="emphasis">Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting</em>, 3rd ed. (New York: Routledge, 2002), 124.</span> In fact, radio advertising was originally considered an unprecedented invasion of privacy, because—unlike newspapers, which were bought at a newsstand—radios were present in the home and spoke with a voice in the presence of the whole family.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_019">Christopher Sterling and John Kittross, <em class="emphasis">Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting</em>, 3rd ed. (New York: Routledge, 2002), 124.</span> However, the social impact of radio was such that within a few years advertising was readily accepted on radio programs. Advertising agencies even began producing their own radio programs named after their products. At first, ads ran only during the day, but as economic pressure mounted during the Great Depression in the 1930s, local stations began looking for new sources of revenue, and advertising became a normal part of the radio soundscape.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_020">Christopher Sterling and John Kittross, <em class="emphasis">Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting</em>, 3rd ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p01">Not long after radio’s broadcast debut, large businesses saw its potential profitability and formed <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">networks</a><span class="glossdef">Originally groups of radio stations that shared the same programming, these became large broadcasting corporations in control of radio programming.</span></span>. In 1926, RCA started the National Broadcasting Network (NBC). Groups of stations that carried syndicated network programs along with a variety of local shows soon formed its Red and Blue networks. Two years after the creation of NBC, the United Independent Broadcasters became the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) and began competing with the existing Red and Blue networks.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_021">Christopher Sterling and John Kittross, <em class="emphasis">Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting</em>, 3rd ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s01_p02">Although early network programming focused mainly on music, it soon developed to include other programs.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s02_p01">In the mid-1920s, profit-seeking companies such as department stores and newspapers owned a majority of the nation’s broadcast radio stations, which promoted their owners’ businesses.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_023">“Radio’s Emergence,” <em class="emphasis">Oracle ThinkQuest: The 1920s</em>, <a class="link" href="http://library.thinkquest.org/27629/themes/media/md20s.html">http://library.thinkquest.org/27629/themes/media/md20s.html</a>.</span> Nonprofit groups such as churches and schools operated another third of the stations. As the number of radio stations outgrew the available frequencies, interference became problematic, and the government stepped into the fray.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s02_p02">The Radio Act of 1927 established the Federal Radio Commission (FRC) to oversee regulation of the airwaves. A year after its creation, the FRC reallocated station bandwidths to correct interference problems. The organization reserved 40 high-powered channels, setting aside 37 of these for network affiliates. The remaining 600 lower-powered bandwidths went to stations that had to share the frequencies; this meant that as one station went off the air at a designated time, another one began broadcasting in its place. The Radio Act of 1927 allowed major networks such as CBS and NBC to gain a 70 percent share of U.S. broadcasting by the early 1930s, earning them $72 million in profits by 1934.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_024">Robert W.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s02_s02_p03">In protest of the favor that the 1927 Radio Act showed toward commercial broadcasting, struggling nonprofit radio broadcasters created the National Committee on Education by Radio to lobby for more outlets. Basing their argument on the notion that the airwaves—unlike newspapers—were a public resource, they asserted that groups working for the public good should take precedence over commercial interests. Nevertheless, the Communications Act of 1934 passed without addressing these issues, and radio continued as a mainly commercial enterprise.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_026">Robert W.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p01">The so-called Golden Age of Radio occurred between 1930 and the mid-1950s. Because many associate the 1930s with the struggles of the Great Depression, it may seem contradictory that such a fruitful cultural occurrence arose during this decade. However, radio lent itself to the era. After the initial purchase of a receiver, radio was free and so provided an inexpensive source of entertainment that replaced other, more costly pastimes, such as going to the movies.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_p02">Radio also presented an easily accessible form of media that existed on its own schedule. Unlike reading newspapers or books, tuning in to a favorite program at a certain time became a part of listeners’ daily routine because it effectively forced them to plan their lives around the dial.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_s01_p01">During the Great Depression, radio became so successful that another network, the Mutual Broadcasting Network, began in 1934 to compete with NBC’s Red and Blue networks and the CBS network, creating a total of four national networks.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_027">Sean Cashman, <em class="emphasis">America in the Twenties and Thirties: The Olympian Age of Franklin Delano Roosevelt</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1989), 328.</span> As the networks became more adept at generating profits, their broadcast selections began to take on a format that later evolved into modern television programming. Serial dramas and programs that focused on domestic work aired during the day when many women were at home. Advertisers targeted this demographic with commercials for domestic needs such as soap.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_028">“Soap Opera,” <em class="emphasis">The Museum of Broadcast Communications</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=soapopera">http://www.museum.tv/eotvsection.php?entrycode=soapopera</a>.</span> Because they were often sponsored by soap companies, daytime serial dramas soon became known as <em class="emphasis">soap operas</em>.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_s03_p01">By the late 1930s, the popularity of radio news broadcasts had surpassed that of newspapers. Radio’s ability to emotionally draw its audiences in close to events made for news that evoked stronger responses and, thus, greater interest than print news could. For example, the infant son of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. Radio networks set up mobile stations that covered events as they unfolded, broadcasting nonstop for several days and keeping listeners updated on every detail while tying them emotionally to the outcome.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_031">Robert Brown, <em class="emphasis">Manipulating the Ether: The Power of Broadcast Radio in Thirties America</em> (Jefferson, NC: MacFarland, 1998), 134–137.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_s03_p02">As recording technology advanced, reporters gained the ability to record events in the field and bring them back to the studio to broadcast over the airwaves. One early example of this was Herb Morrison’s recording of the <em class="emphasis">Hindenburg</em> disaster. In 1937, the <em class="emphasis">Hindenburg</em> blimp exploded into flames while attempting to land, killing 37 of its passengers. Morrison was already on the scene to record the descent, capturing the fateful crash. The entire event was later broadcast, including the sound of the exploding blimp, providing listeners with an unprecedented emotional connection to a national disaster. Morrison’s exclamation “Oh, the humanity!” became a common phrase of despair after the event.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_032">Robert Brown, <em class="emphasis">Manipulating the Ether: The Power of Broadcast Radio in Thirties America</em> (Jefferson, NC: MacFarland, 1998), 141–142.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_s03_p03">Radio news became even more important during World War II, when programs such as Norman Corwin’s <em class="emphasis">This Is War!</em> sought to bring more sober news stories to a radio dial dominated by entertainment.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_s05_p01">Despite the networks’ hold on programming, educational stations persisted at universities and in some municipalities. They broadcast programs such as the <em class="emphasis">School of the Air</em> and <em class="emphasis">College of the Air</em> as well as roundtable and town hall forums. In 1940, the FCC reserved a set of frequencies in the lower range of the FM radio spectrum for public education purposes as part of its regulation of the new spectrum. The reservation of FM frequencies gave educational stations a boost, but FM proved intitally unpopular due to a setback in 1945, when the FCC moved the FM bandwidth to a higher set of frequencies, ostensibly to avoid problems with interference.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_039">Lawrence D. Longley, “The FM Shift in 1945,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Broadcasting</em> 12, no. 4 (1968): 353–365.</span> This change required the purchase of new equipment by both consumers and radio stations, thus greatly slowing the widespread adoption of FM radio.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_s05_p02">One enduring anomaly in the field of educational stations has been the Pacifica Radio network. Begun in 1949 to counteract the effects of commercial radio by bringing educational programs and dialogue to the airwaves, Pacifica has grown from a single station—Berkeley, California’s KPFA—to a network of five stations and more than 100 affiliates.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_040">“Pacifica Network Stations,” <em class="emphasis">The Pacifica Foundation</em>, <a class="link" href="http://pacificanetwork.org/radio/content/section/7/42/">http://pacificanetwork.org/radio/content/section/7/42/</a>.</span> From the outset, Pacifica aired newer classical, jazz, and folk music along with lectures, discussions, and interviews with public artists and intellectuals. Among Pacifica’s major innovations was its refusal to take money from commercial advertisers, relying instead on donations from listeners and grants from institutions such as the Ford Foundation and calling itself listener-supported.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_041">Jack Mitchell, <em class="emphasis">Listener Supported: The Culture and History of Public Radio</em> (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2005), 21–24.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s03_s05_p03">Another important innovation on the fringes of the radio dial during this time was the growth of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">border stations</a><span class="glossdef">Stations located just over the United States–Mexico border that broadcast into the United States without being subject to its regulations.</span></span>. Located just across the Mexican border, these stations did not have to follow FCC or U.S. regulatory laws. Because the stations broadcast at 250,000 watts and higher, their listening range covered much of North America. Their content also diverged—at the time markedly—from that of U.S. stations. For example, Dr. John Brinkley started station XERF in Del Rio, Mexico, after being forced to shut down his station in Nebraska, and he used the border station in part to promote a dubious goat gland operation that supposedly cured sexual impotence.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_042">Mike Dash, “John Brinkley, the goat-gland quack,” <em class="emphasis">The Telegraph</em>, April 18, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3671561/John-Brinkley-the-goat-gland-quack.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/non_fictionreviews/3671561/John-Brinkley-the-goat-gland-quack.html</a>.</span> Besides the goat gland promotion, the station and others like it often carried music, like country and western, that could not be heard on regular network radio.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s04_p01">A great deal of radio’s success as a medium during the 1920s and 1930s was due to the fact that no other medium could replicate it. This changed in the late 1940s and early 1950s as television became popular.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Transition to Top 40</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s05_p01">As radio networks abandoned the dramas and variety shows that had previously sustained their formats, the soundscape was left to what radio could still do better than any other mass medium: play music. With advertising dollars down and the emergence of better recording formats, it made good business sense for radio to focus on shows that played prerecorded music. As strictly music stations began to rise, new innovations to increase their profitability appeared. One of the most notable and far-reaching of these innovations was the Top 40 station, a concept that supposedly came from watching jukebox patrons continually play the same songs.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_048">Bill Brewster and Frank Broughton, <em class="emphasis">Last Night a DJ Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey</em>, (New York: Grove Press, 2000), 48.</span> Robert Storz and Gordon McLendon began adapting existing radio stations to fit this new format with great success. In 1956, the creation of limited playlists further refined the format by providing about 50 songs that disc jockeys played repeatedly every day. By the early 1960s, many stations had developed limited playlists of only 30 songs.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_049">Jesse Walker, <em class="emphasis">Rebels on the Air: An Alternative History of Radio in America</em> (New York: New York University Press, 2001), 56.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s05_p02">Another musically fruitful innovation came with the increase of black disc jockeys and programs created for black audiences. Because its advertisers had nowhere to go in a media market dominated by white performers, black radio became more common on the AM dial. As traditional programming left radio, disc jockeys began to develop as the medium’s new personalities, talking more in between songs and developing followings. Early black disc jockeys even began improvising rhymes over top of the music, pioneering techniques that later became rap and hip-hop. This new personality-driven style helped bring early rock and roll to new audiences.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_050">Jesse Walker, <em class="emphasis">Rebels on the Air: An Alternative History of Radio in America</em> (New York: New York University Press, 2001), 54–55.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s06_p01">As music came to rule the airwaves, FM radio drew in new listeners because of its high-fidelity sound capabilities. When radio had primarily featured dramas and other talk-oriented formats, sound quality had simply not mattered to many people, and the purchase of an FM receiver did not compete with the purchase of a new television in terms of entertainment value. As FM receivers decreased in price and stereo recording technology became more popular, however, the high-fidelity trend created a market for FM stations. Mostly affluent consumers began purchasing component stereos with the goal of getting the highest sound quality possible out of their recordings.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_051">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 266–268.</span> Although this audience often preferred classical and jazz stations to Top 40 radio, they were tolerant of new music and ideas.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_052">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 266–268.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s06_p02">Both the high-fidelity market and the growing youth counterculture of the 1960s had similar goals for the FM spectrum. Both groups eschewed AM radio because of the predictable programming, poor sound quality, and over-commercialization. Both groups wanted to treat music as an important experience rather than as just a trendy pastime or a means to make money. Many adherents to the youth counterculture of the 1960s came from affluent, middle-class families, and their tastes came to define a new era of consumer culture. The goals and market potential of both the high-fidelity lovers and the youth counterculture created an atmosphere on the FM dial that had never before occurred.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_053">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 276–277.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s06_p03">Between the years 1960 and 1966, the number of households capable of receiving FM transmissions grew from about 6.5 million to some 40 million. The FCC also aided FM by issuing its nonduplication ruling in 1964. Before this regulation, many AM stations had other stations on the FM spectrum that simply duplicated the AM programming. The nonduplication rule forced FM stations to create their own fresh programming, opening up the spectrum for established networks to develop new stations.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_054">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 267.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s06_p04">The late 1960s saw new disc jockeys taking greater liberties with established practices; these liberties included playing several songs in a row before going to a commercial break or airing album tracks that exceeded 10 minutes in length. University stations and other nonprofit ventures to which the FCC had given frequencies during the late 1940s popularized this format, and, in time, commercial stations tried to duplicate their success by playing fewer commercials and by allowing their disc jockeys to have a say in their playlists. Although this made for popular listening formats, FM stations struggled to make the kinds of profits that the AM spectrum drew.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_055">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 270.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s06_p05">In 1974, FM radio accounted for one-third of all radio listening but only 14 percent of radio profits.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_056">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 270.</span> Large network stations and advertisers began to market heavily to the FM audience in an attempt to correct this imbalance. Stations began tightening their playlists and narrowing their formats to please advertisers and to generate greater revenues. By the end of the 1970s, radio stations were beginning to play specific formats, and the progressive radio of the previous decade had become difficult to find.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_057">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 275–278.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Rise of Public Radio</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s07_p01">After the Golden Age of Radio came to an end, most listeners tuned in to radio stations to hear music. The variety shows and talk-based programs that had sustained radio in early years could no longer draw enough listeners to make them a successful business proposition. One divergent path from this general trend, however, was the growth of public radio.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s07_p02">Groups such as the Ford Foundation had funded public media sources during the early 1960s. When the foundation decided to withdraw its funding in the middle of the decade, the federal government stepped in with the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. This act created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) and charged it with generating funding for public television and radio outlets. The CPB in turn created National Public Radio (NPR) in 1970 to provide programming for already-operating stations. Until 1982, in fact, the CPB entirely and exclusively funded NPR. Public radio’s first program was <em class="emphasis">All Things Considered</em>, an evening news program that focused on analysis and interpretive reporting rather than cutting-edge coverage. In the mid-1970s, NPR attracted Washington-based journalists such as Cokie Roberts and Linda Wertheimer to its ranks, giving the coverage a more professional, hard-reporting edge.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_058">Sue Schardt, “Public Radio—A Short History,” Christian Science Monitor Publishing Company, 1996, <a class="link" href="http://www.wsvh.org/pubradiohist.htm">http://www.wsvh.org/pubradiohist.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s01_s07_p03">However, in 1983, public radio was pushed to the brink of financial collapse. NPR survived in part by relying more on its member stations to hold fundraising drives, now a vital component of public radio’s business model. In 2003, Joan Kroc, the widow of McDonald’s CEO and philanthropist Ray Kroc, bequeathed a grant of over $200 million to NPR that may keep it afloat for many years to come.</p>
