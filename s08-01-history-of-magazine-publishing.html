        <h2 class="title editable block">Early Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">After the printing press became prevalent in Europe, early publishers began to conceptualize the magazine. Forerunners of the familiar modern magazine first appeared during the 17th century in the form of brochures, pamphlets, and almanacs. Soon, publishers realized that irregular publication schedules required too much time and energy. A gradual shift then occurred as publishers sought regular readers with specific interests. But the early magazine was unlike any other previous publication. It was not enough of a news source to be a newspaper, but it could not be considered pleasure reading either. Instead, early magazines occupied the middle ground between the two. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_009"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Germany, France, and the Netherlands Lead the Way</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p01">German theologian and poet Johann Rist published the first true magazine between 1663 and 1668. Titled <em class="emphasis">Erbauliche Monaths-Unterredungen</em>, or <em class="emphasis">Edifying Monthly Discussions</em>, Rist’s publication inspired a number of others to begin printing literary journals across Europe: Denis de Sallo’s French <em class="emphasis">Journal des Sçavans</em> (1665), the Royal Society’s English <em class="emphasis">Philosophical Transactions</em> (1665), and Francesco Nazzari’s Italian <em class="emphasis">Giomale de’letterati</em> (1668). In 1684, exiled Frenchman Pierre Bayle published <em class="emphasis">Novelles de la République des Lettres</em> in the Netherlands to escape French censorship. Profoundly affected by a general revival of learning during the 1600s, the publications inspired enthusiasm for education.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p02">Another Frenchman, Jean Donneau de Vizé, published the first “periodical of amusement,” <em class="emphasis">Le Mercure Galant</em> (later renamed <em class="emphasis">Mercure de France</em>), in 1672, which contained news, short stories, and poetry. This combination of news and pleasurable reading became incredibly popular, causing other publications to imitate the magazine.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_010"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> This lighter magazine catered to a different reader than did the other, more intellectual publications of the day, offering articles for entertainment and enjoyment rather than for education.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p03">With the arrival of the 18th century came an increase in literacy. Women, who enjoyed a considerable rise in literacy rates, began reading in record numbers. This growth affected the literary world as a whole, inspiring a large number of female writers to publish novels for female readers.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_011">Abby Wolf, “Introduction,” 19th Century Women Writers, PBS, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wives/writers/intro.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wives/writers/intro.html</a>.</span> This influx of female readers also helped magazines flourish as more women sought out the publications as a source of knowledge and entertainment. In fact, many magazines jumped at the chance to reach out to women. The <em class="emphasis">Athenian Mercury</em>, the first magazine written specifically for women, appeared in 1693.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p01">Much as in newspaper publication, Great Britain closely followed Continental Europe’s lead in producing magazines. During the early 18th century, three major influential magazines published regularly in Great Britain: <em class="emphasis">Robinson Crusoe</em> author Daniel Defoe’s the <em class="emphasis">Review</em>, Sir Richard Steele’s the <em class="emphasis">Tatler</em>, and Joseph Addison and Steele’s the <em class="emphasis">Spectator</em>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s02_p02">All three of these publications were published either daily or several times a week. While they were supplied as frequently as newspapers, their content was closer to that of magazines. The <em class="emphasis">Review</em> focused primarily on domestic and foreign affairs and featured opinion-based political articles. The <em class="emphasis">Spectator</em> replaced the <em class="emphasis">Tatler</em>, which published from 1709 to 1711. Both <em class="emphasis">Tatler</em> and <em class="emphasis">Spectator</em> emphasized living and culture and frequently used humor to promote virtuous behavior.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_012">Abby Wolf, “Introduction,” 19th Century Women Writers, PBS, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wives/writers/intro.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wives/writers/intro.html</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">Tatler</em> and <em class="emphasis">Spectator</em>, in particular, drew a large number of female readers, and both magazines eventually added female-targeted publications: <em class="emphasis">Female Tatler</em> in 1709 and <em class="emphasis">Female Spectator</em> in 1744.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">American Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p01">The first American magazines debuted in 1741, when Andrew Bradford’s <em class="emphasis">American Magazine</em> and Benjamin Franklin’s <em class="emphasis">General Magazine</em> began publication in Philadelphia a mere 3 days apart from each other. Neither magazine lasted long, however; <em class="emphasis">American Magazine</em> folded after only 3 months and <em class="emphasis">General Magazine</em> after 6. The short-lived nature of the publications likely had less to do with the outlets themselves and more to do with the fact that they were “limited by too few readers with leisure time to read, high costs of publishing, and expensive distribution systems.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_013">Joseph Straubhaar, Robert Larose, and Lucinda Davenport, <em class="emphasis">Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology</em> (Boston: Wadsworth, 2009).</span> Regardless of this early setback, magazines began to flourish during the latter half of the 18th century, and by the end of the 1700s, more than 100 magazines had appeared in the nascent United States. Despite this large publication figure, typical colonial magazines still recorded low <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">circulation</a><span class="glossdef">The number of copies of a magazine distributed.</span></span> figures and were considered highbrow.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Mass-Appeal Magazines</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p01">All this changed during the 1830s when publishers began taking advantage of a general decline in the cost of printing and mailing publications and started producing less-expensive magazines with a wider audience in mind. Magazine style also transformed. While early magazines focused on improvement and reason, later versions focused on amusement. No longer were magazines focused on the elite class. Publishers took advantage of their freshly expanded audience and began offering family magazines, children’s magazines, and women’s magazines. Women’s publications again proved to be a highly lucrative market. One of the earliest American women’s magazines was <em class="emphasis">Godey’s Lady’s Book</em>, a Philadelphia-based monthly that printed between 1830 and 1898. This particular magazine reached out to female readers by employing nearly 150 women.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s01_p01">The first truly successful mass circulation magazine in the United States was <em class="emphasis">The Saturday Evening Post</em>. This weekly magazine first began printing in 1821 and remained in regular print production until 1969, when it briefly ceased circulation. However, in 1971 a new owner remodeled the magazine to focus on health and medical breakthroughs. From the time of its first publication in the early 1800s, <em class="emphasis">The Saturday Evening Post</em> quickly grew in popularity; by 1855, it had a circulation of 90,000 copies per year.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_014"><em class="emphasis">Saturday Evening Post</em>, “About,” <a class="link" href="http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/about">http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/about</a>.</span> Widely recognized for transforming the look of the magazine, the publication was the first to put artwork on its cover, a decision that <em class="emphasis">The Saturday Evening Post</em> has said “connected readers intimately with the magazine as a whole.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_015"><em class="emphasis">Saturday Evening Post</em>, “About,” <a class="link" href="http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/about">http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/about</a>.</span> Certainly, <em class="emphasis">The Saturday Evening Post</em> took advantage of the format by featuring the work of famous artists such as Norman Rockwell. Using such recognizable artists boosted circulation as “Americans everywhere recognized the art of the <em class="emphasis">Post</em> and eagerly awaited the next issue because of it.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_016"><em class="emphasis">Saturday Evening Post</em>, “About,” <a class="link" href="http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/about">http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/about</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s02_p01">Another early U.S. mass magazine was <em class="emphasis">Youth’s Companion</em>, which published between 1827 and 1929 when it merged with <em class="emphasis">The American Boy</em>. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, this periodical featured fairly religious content and developed a reputation as a wholesome magazine that encouraged young readers to be virtuous and pious. Eventually, the magazine sought to reach a larger, adult audience by including tame entertainment pieces. Nevertheless, the magazine in time began featuring the work of prominent writers for both children and adults and became “a literary force to be reckoned with.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_017">“Youth’s Companion,” Nineteenth-Century American Children and What They Read: Some of Their Magazines, <a class="link" href="http://www.merrycoz.org/MAGS2.HTM">http://www.merrycoz.org/MAGS2.HTM</a>.</span></p>

                <h2 class="title editable block">Price Decreases Attract Larger Audiences</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s03_p01">While magazines such as <em class="emphasis">The Saturday Evening Post</em> and <em class="emphasis">Youth’s Companion</em> were fairly popular, the industry still struggled to achieve widespread circulation. Most publications cost the then-hefty sum of 25 or 35 cents per issue, limiting readership to the relative few who could afford them. This all changed in 1893 when Samuel Sidney McClure began selling <em class="emphasis">McClure’s Magazine</em>, originally a literary and political magazine, at the bargain price of only 15 cents per issue. The trend caught on. Soon, <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> (founded 1886) began selling for 12.5 cents, while <em class="emphasis">Munsey Magazine</em> (1886–1929) sold for only 10 cents. All three of these periodicals were widely successful. Frank A. Munsey, owner of <em class="emphasis">Munsey Magazine</em>, estimated that between 1893 and 1899 “the ten-cent magazine increased the magazine-buying public from 250,000 to 750,000 persons.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_018"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> For the first time, magazines could be sold for less than they cost to produce. Because of greater circulation, publications could charge more for advertising space and decrease the cost to the customer.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_s03_p02">By 1900, advertising had become a crucial component of the magazine business. In the early days of the industry, many publications attempted to keep advertisements out of their issues because of publishers’ natural fondness toward literature and writing.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_019"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> However, once circulation increased, advertisers sought out space in magazines to reach the larger audience. Magazines responded by raising advertising rates, ultimately increasing their profitability. By the turn of the 20th century, advertising became the norm in magazines, particularly in some women’s magazine, where advertisements accounted for nearly half of all content.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p01">As publishers became interested in succinctly presenting the fresh increase of worldwide information that technology made available during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they designed the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">newsmagazine</a><span class="glossdef">A journal that specializes in reporting and commenting on current events.</span></span>. In 1923, <em class="emphasis">Time</em> became the first newsmagazine that focused on world news. <em class="emphasis">Time</em> first began publication with the proposition that “people are uninformed because no publication has adapted itself to the time which busy men are able to spend simply keeping informed.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_020"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> Although the periodical struggled during its early years, <em class="emphasis">Time</em> hit its stride in 1928 and its readership grew. The magazine’s signature style of well-researched news presented in a succinct manner contributed greatly to its eventual success.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p02">Several other newsmagazines came onto the market during this era as well. <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em> was founded in 1929 with a focus on the global market. <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, currently one of the most popular financial magazines, began printing in 1917 as a biweekly publication. In 1933, a former <em class="emphasis">Time</em> foreign editor founded <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, which now has a circulation of nearly 4 million readers. Today, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> and <em class="emphasis">Time</em> continue to compete with each other, furthering a trend that began in the early years of <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>.</p>

The most influential picture magazine was Henry Luce’s <em class="emphasis">Life</em>, which regularly published between 1936 and 1972. Within weeks of its initial publication, <em class="emphasis">Life</em> had a circulation of 1 million.
