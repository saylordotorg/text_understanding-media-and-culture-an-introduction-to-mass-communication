        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p01">A New York City woman lost her cell phone in the back of a taxi cab. Sasha Gomez, 16, of Queens, ended up with the phone. She decided to keep it and use it. She did not realize the consequences. She was humiliated, harassed, and arrested. And she became the subject of a public shaming ritual only possible by today’s media in today’s culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p02">The phone was an expensive model, a T-Mobile Sidekick that sold for $350. Sasha began using the phone to take photographs and send instant messages to friends and family. The woman who lost the phone thought she would never see the phone again. She bought another Sidekick, logged onto her account and found that the old phone was being used. She saw photographs and messages by Sasha. The woman wanted her old phone back. She had a media-savvy friend, Evan Guttman. Evan was able to track down Sasha by her instant messages. He contacted Sasha and asked her to return the phone to his friend. “Basically, she told me to get lost,” Evan later told <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_001">Nicholas Confessore, “Tale of a Lost Cellphone, and Untold Static,” <em class="emphasis">The New York Times,</em> June 21, 2006. Web. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/nyregion/21sidekick.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=evan+guttman&amp;st=nyt">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/nyregion/21sidekick.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=evan+guttman&amp;st=nyt</a></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p03">Evan decided to fight for his friend’s phone—through the media. He put up a web page that told the story of the lost cell phone. He put up the pictures of Sasha and her family. The story spread. Evan began getting dozens and then hundreds of sympathetic emails from other people who had lost phones and understood his frustration with Sasha. Two technology blogs, Diggs and Gizmodo, linked to the story and web page. Evan then got thousands of emails, some from as far off as Africa and Asia. Lawyers and police officers contacted Evan about property law and told him how to approach the police. Some people went further than writing supportive emails. They found Sasha’s MySpace page. They sent Sasha and her friends messages demanding the return of the phone. Other people learned her home address in Queens, drove by her apartment building and shouted “thief.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p04">Sasha and her family were outraged and alarmed. They contacted Evan. Sasha still refused to return the phone. Her brother too communicated with Evan. He said he was a military policeman, and he warned Evan to leave Sasha alone. Evan posted those comments online. He soon heard from others in the military. They told him that the brother’s threats were a violation of military policy. They said they would report the threats to the brother’s superiors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p05">Armed with all this information, Evan contacted Sasha one more time. He said he and his friend would next go the police. Evan said he was threatened again. He and his friend went to the police who then arrested Sasha. The charge was possession of stolen property. Sasha’s mother came forward and said she had bought the phone for $50 on a subway platform and given it to Sasha. Police confiscated the phone for the original owner. And Evan became a minor cultural celebrity. The story appeared in <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> and the <em class="emphasis">International Herald Tribune</em> and was broadcast on MSNBC and other outlets. It was a modern morality tale caused by, and then made possible by, the intersection of media technology and culture.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p06">I thought the story of the lost cell phone would be a great introduction for a text on understanding media and culture and used <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> story to write the previous paragraphs. Long after, when I showed the introduction to a colleague, he looked at me and said, “Are you kidding?” He showed me a then-recent book by media scholar Clay Shirky, <em class="emphasis">Here Comes Everybody</em>, a book on the power of organizing through new media. Shirky begins his book—with the same story of the lost cell phone. With some wry amusement over fate, I decided that I would keep my introduction as well. In some ways, the movement of the lost cell phone story from Evan’s website through <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> through MSNBC through Clay Shirky’s text through my book on understanding media and culture is symbolic, as we will see, of the multitude of flows between media and culture.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Understanding Media and Culture</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p07">This book’s title tells its intent. It is written to help you understand media and culture. The media and culture are so much a part of our days that sometimes it is difficult to step back and appreciate and apprehend their great impact on our lives.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p08">The book’s title, and the book itself, begin with a focus squarely on media. Think of your typical day. If you are like many people, you wake to a digital alarm clock or perhaps your cell phone. Soon after waking, you likely have a routine that involves some media. Some people immediately check the cell phone for text messages. Others will turn on the computer and check Facebook, email, or websites. Some people read the newspaper. Others listen to music on an iPod or CD. Some people will turn on the television and watch a weather channel, cable news, or Sports Center. Heading to work or class, you may chat on a cell phone or listen to music. Your classes likely employ various types of media from course management software to PowerPoint presentations to DVDs to YouTube. You may return home and relax with video games, television, movies, more Facebook, or music. You connect with friends on campus and beyond with text messages or Facebook. And your day may end as you fall asleep to digital music. Media for most of us are entwined with almost every aspect of life and work. Understanding media will not only help you appreciate the role of media in your life but also help you be a more informed citizen, a more savvy consumer, and a more successful worker. Media influence all those aspects of life as well.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p09">The book’s title also has links to a highly influential book in media studies, <em class="emphasis">Understanding Media</em>, by the social theorist and critic, Marshall McLuhan.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_002">Marshall McLuhan, <em class="emphasis">Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man</em>. New York: McGraw Hill, 1964.</span> In the midst of the 20th century and the rise of television as a mass medium, McLuhan foresaw how profoundly media would shape human lives. His work on media spanned four decades, from the 1950s to his death in 1980. In the 1960s and 1970s, during the height of television’s popularity and the emergence of computers, he became an international celebrity. He appeared on magazine covers and television talk shows. He had a cameo appearance in the Woody Allen film, <em class="emphasis">Annie Hall</em>. <em class="emphasis">Wired</em> magazine listed him on its masthead as “patron saint.” In universities, however, McLuhan was often dismissed, perhaps because of his celebrity, his outlandish style, and his broad and sweeping declarations. Yet as media continued to develop in ways anticipated by his writings, McLuhan again found an audience in media studies.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p10">In <em class="emphasis">Understanding Media</em>, McLuhan offered some provocative thoughts. He said that the media themselves were far more important than any content they carried. Indeed, he said, each medium, such as print or broadcast, physically affects the human central nervous system in a certain way. Media influence the way the brain works and how it processes information. They create new patterns of thought and behavior. Looking back over time, McLuhan found that people and societies were shaped by the dominant media of their time. For example, McLuhan argued, people and societies of the printing press era were shaped by that medium. And, he said, people and societies were being shaped in new ways by electronic media. Summing up, in one of his well-known phrases, he said, “The medium is the message.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p11">This book’s title uses McLuhan’s title—and adds culture. McLuhan well understood how media shape culture. However, one weakness in McLuhan’s work, especially his early work, is that he did not fully account for how culture shapes media. Culture can be a vague and empty term. Sometimes culture is defined in a very narrow sense as “the arts” or some sort of fashionable refinement. Another definition of culture is much more expansive, however. In this broader sense, culture is a particular way of life and how that life is acted out each day in works, practices, and activities. Thus, we can talk about Italian culture, Javanese culture, or the culture of the ancient Greeks. Another communication theorist, James Carey, elegantly captures this expansive view of culture. In “A Cultural Approach to Communication,” Carey wrote the following:</p>
            <span class="blockquote" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_s01_bl01">
                <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p12">“We create, express, and convey our knowledge of and attitudes toward reality through the construction of a variety of symbol systems: art, science, journalism, religion, common sense, mythology. How do we do this? What are the differences between these forms? What are the historical and comparative variations in them? How do changes in communication technology influence what we can concretely create and apprehend? How do groups in society struggle over the definition of what is real?”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_003">James Carey, “A Cultural Approach to Communication,” in <em class="emphasis">Communication as Culture: Essays on Media and Society</em>. 2nd ed. New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2006, p. 24.</span></p>
            </span>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s00_p13">That large sense of culture will be used in this book. The chapters to come will provide an in-depth look at the relationship of media and culture. We will look at many kinds of media and how those media shape and are shaped by culture. Media and culture shape each other around the globe, of course. The focus in this book primarily will be on the United States. This focus is not because U.S. media have such global reach but because understanding media and culture in one setting will allow you to think about media and culture in other settings. This intellectual journey should be interesting and fun. You live, study, work, and play with media in culture. By the book’s end, you should have a much deeper appreciation and understanding of them.</p>
