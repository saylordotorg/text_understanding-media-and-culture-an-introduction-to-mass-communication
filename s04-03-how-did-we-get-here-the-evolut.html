    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_p01">We have spoken easily of <em class="emphasis">historical eras.</em> Can we speak of <em class="emphasis">cultural eras</em>? It can actually be a useful concept. There are many ways to divide time into cultural eras. But for our purposes, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cultural period</a><span class="glossdef">A time marked by a particular way of understanding the world through culture and technology.</span></span> is a time marked by a particular way of understanding the world through culture and technology. Changes in cultural periods are marked by fundamental changes in the way we perceive and understand the world. For example, you may have had readings about the “Middle Ages,” a marker for European history from the 5th to 15th Century. In that era, technology and communication were in the hands of authorities like the king and church who could dictate what was “true.” The Renaissance, the era that followed the Middle Ages, turned to the scientific method as a means of reaching truth through reason. This change in cultural period was galvanized by the printing press. (In 2008, <em class="emphasis">Wired</em> magazine’s editor-in-chief proclaimed that the application of Internet technology through Google was about to render the scientific method obsolete.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_016">Chris Anderson, “The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, June 23, 2008, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory">http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/magazine/16-07/pb_theory</a> (accessed July 15, 2010).</span>) In each of these cultural eras, the nature of truth had not changed. What had changed was the way that humans used available technology to make sense of the world.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_p02">Using technology to make sense of the world? You likely can anticipate that for the purpose of studying culture and mass media, the modern and postmodern ages are some of the most exciting and relevant ones to explore, eras in which culture and technology have intersected like never before.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">The Modern Age—Modernity</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Modern Age</a><span class="glossdef">The post-Medieval era; a wide span of time marked in part by technological innovations, urbanization, scientific discoveries, and globalization. It is also referred to as modernity.</span></span> is the post-Medieval era, beginning roughly after the 14th century, a wide span of time marked in part by technological innovations, urbanization, scientific discoveries, and globalization. The Modern Age is generally split into two parts: the early and the late modern periods. Scholars often talk of the Modern Age as modernity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p02">The <em class="emphasis">early modern period</em> began with Gutenberg’s invention of the movable type printing press in the late 15th century and ended in the late 18th century. Thanks to Gutenberg’s press, the European population of the early modern period saw rising literacy rates, which led to educational reform. As noted earlier, Gutenberg’s machine also greatly enabled the spread of knowledge, and in turn spurred the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation. During the early modern period, transportation improved, politics became more secularized, capitalism spread, nation-states grew more powerful, and information became more widely accessible. Enlightenment ideals of reason, rationalism, and faith in scientific inquiry slowly began to replace the previously dominant authority of king and church.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p03">Huge political, social, and economic changes marked the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the <em class="emphasis">late modern period</em>. The Industrial Revolution, which began in England around 1750, combined with the American Revolution in 1776 and the French Revolution in 1789, indicated that the world was undergoing massive changes. The Industrial Revolution had far-reaching consequences. It did not merely change the way goods were produced—it also fundamentally changed the economic, social, and cultural framework of its time.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p04">The Industrial Revolution doesn’t have clear start or end dates. However, during the 19th century, several crucial inventions—the internal combustion engine, steam-powered ships, and railways, among others—led to other innovations across various industries. Suddenly, steam power and machine tools meant that production increased dramatically. But some of the biggest changes coming out of the Industrial Revolution were social in character. An economy based on manufacturing instead of agriculture meant that more people moved to cities, where techniques of mass production led to an emphasis on efficiency both in and out of the factory. Newly urbanized factory laborers no longer had the skill or time to produce their own food, clothing, or supplies and instead turned to consumer goods. Increased production led to increases in wealth, though income inequalities between classes also started to grow as well. Increased wealth and nonrural lifestyles led to the development of entertainment industries. Life changed rapidly.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p05">It is no coincidence that the French and American Revolutions happened in the midst of the Industrial Revolution. The huge social changes created changes in political systems and thinking. In both France and America, the revolutions were inspired by a rejection of a monarchy in favor of national sovereignty and representative democracy. Both revolutions also heralded the rise of secular society, as opposed to church-based authority systems. Democracy was well-suited to the so-called Age of Reason, with its ideals of individual rights and its belief in progress.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p06">Media were central to these revolutions. As we have seen, the fusing of steam power and the printing press enabled the explosive expansion of books and newspapers. Literacy rates rose, as did support for public participation in politics. More and more people lived in the city, had an education, got their news from the newspaper, spent their wages on consumer goods, and identified themselves as citizens of an industrialized nation. Urbanization, mass literacy, and new forms of mass media contributed to a sense of mass culture that united people across regional, social, and cultural boundaries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p07">A last note on the terminology for the cultural era of the Modern Age or modernity: A similar term—modernism—also has come into use. However, modernism is a term for an artistic, cultural movement, rather than era. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Modernism</a><span class="glossdef">An artistic movement of late-19th and early-20th centuries that arose out of the widespread changes that swept the world during that period, and that questioned the limitations of “traditional” forms of art and culture.</span></span> refers to the artistic movement of late-19th and early-20th centuries that arose out of the widespread changes that swept the world during that period. Most notably, modernism questioned the limitations of “traditional” forms of art and culture. Modernist art was in part a reaction against the Enlightenment’s certainty of progress and rationality. It celebrated subjectivity through abstraction, experimentalism, surrealism, and sometimes pessimism or even nihilism. Prominent examples of modernist works include James Joyce’s stream-of-consciousness novels, cubist paintings by Picasso, atonal compositions by Debussy, and absurdist plays by Pirandello. It’s not too confusing—modernism was an artistic movement taking place during the modern age.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Postmodern Age</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p01">If you go on to graduate study in almost any field in the humanities or social sciences, you will eventually encounter texts debating the <em class="emphasis">postmodern era</em>. While the exact definition and dates of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">postmodern era</a><span class="glossdef">A cultural period that began during the second half of the 20th century and was marked by skepticism, self-consciousness, celebration of difference, and the reappraisal of modern conventions.</span></span> are still debated by cultural theorists and philosophers, the general consensus is that the postmodern era began during the second half of the 20th century, and was marked by skepticism, self-consciousness, celebration of difference, and the reappraisal of modern conventions. Modernity—the Modern Age—took for granted scientific rationalism, the autonomous self, and the inevitability of progress. The postmodern age questioned or dismissed many of these assumptions. If the modern age valued order, reason, stability, and absolute truth, the postmodern age reveled in contingency, fragmentation, and instability. The aftermath of World War II, the Holocaust, the Cold War, the digitization of culture, the rise of the Internet, and numerous other factors fed into the skepticism and self-consciousness of the postmodern era.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p02">Modernity’s belief in objective truth is one of the major assumptions turned on its head in the postmodern era. Postmodernists instead took their cues from Schrödinger, the quantum physicist who famously devised a thought experiment in which a cat is placed inside a sealed box with a small amount of radiation that may or may not kill it. (Remember, this is a thought experiment, and is not real.) While the box remains sealed, Schrödinger proclaimed, the cat exists simultaneously in both states, dead <em class="emphasis">and</em> alive. Both potential states are equally true. Although the thought experiment was devised to explore issues in quantum physics, it appealed to postmodernists in its assertion of radical uncertainty. What is reality? Rather than being an absolute objective truth, accessible by rational procedures and experimentation, the status of reality was contingent, and depended on the observer.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p03">“The postmodern” affected fields from philosophy to political science to literature. Novelists and poets, for example, embraced this new approach to reality. While Victorian novelists took pains to make their books seem more “real,” postmodern narratives distrusted professions of “reality” and constantly reminded readers of the artificial nature of the story they were reading. The emphasis was not on the all-knowing author but instead on the reader. For the postmodernists, meaning was not injected into a work by its creator, but depended on the reader’s subjective experience of the work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p04">Another way postmodernity differed from modernity was in its rejection of what philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard deemed “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">grand narratives</a><span class="glossdef">Large-scale theories that attempt to explain the totality of human experience.</span></span>.” The Modern Age was marked by different large-scale theories that attempted to explain the totality of human experience, including theories of capitalism, Marxism, rationalism, Freudianism, Darwinism, fascism, and so on. But the postmodern era called into question the sorts of theories that claimed to explain everything at once. Such thinking, postmodernists warned, led to 20th-century totalitarian regimes, such as Hitler’s Third Reich and the USSR under Stalin. The postmodern age, Lyotard theorized, was one of micro-narratives instead of grand narratives—that is, a multiplicity of small, localized understandings of the world, none of which can claim an ultimate or absolute truth. The diversity of human experience also was a marked feature of the postmodern world. As Lyotard noted, “eclecticism is the degree zero of contemporary general culture; one listens to reggae, watches a Western, eats McDonald’s food for lunch and local cuisine for dinner, wears Paris perfume in Tokyo and retro clothes in Hong Kong; knowledge is a matter for TV games.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn01_017">Jean-Francois Lyotard, <em class="emphasis">The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1984).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch01_s03_s02_p05">Postmodernists even mistrusted the idea of originality—the supposed arrogance of thinking one had a “new thought”—and freely borrowed across cultures and genres. William S. Burroughs gleefully proclaimed a sort of call-to-arms for his postmodern generation of writers in 1985: “Out of the closets and into the museums, libraries, architectural monuments, concert halls, bookstores, recording studios and film studios of the world. Everything belongs to the inspired and dedicated thief.…Words, colors, light, sounds, stone, wood, bronze belong to the living artist. They belong to anyone who can use them. Loot the Louvre! <em class="emphasis">A bas l’originalité</em> (down with originality), the sterile and assertive ego that imprisons us as it creates. <em class="emphasis">Vive le sol</em> (long live the sun)-pure, shameless, total. We are not responsible. Steal anything in sight.” Burroughs’s words embodied the mixed skepticism and glee that marked the postmodern era. As the new millennium began, Bob Dylan’s album, “Love and Theft,” carried on Burroughs’s tradition. Its title and many of its lyrics are taken from numerous sources across cultures, eras and fields.</p>

                <li>A cultural period is a time marked by a particular way of understanding the world through culture and technology. Changes in cultural periods are marked by fundamental changes in the way we perceive and understand the world. The modern era began after the Middle Ages and lasted through the early decades of the 20th century, when the postmodern era began.</li>
                <li>The modern era was marked by Enlightenment philosophy, which focused on the individual and placed a high value on rational decision making. This period saw the wide expansion of capitalism, colonialism, democracy, and science-based rationalism. The Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation, the American and French Revolutions, and World War I are all significant events that took place during the modern era. One of the most significant, however, was the Industrial Revolution; its emphasis on routinization and efficiency helped society restructure itself along those terms as well.</li>
                <li>Postmodernity differed from modernity in its questioning of reason, rejection of grand narratives, and emphasis on subcultures. Rather than searching for one ultimate truth that could explain all of history, the postmodernists focused on contingency, context, and diversity.</li>
