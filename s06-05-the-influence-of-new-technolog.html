    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_p01">The book industry has changed enormously since its creation. From the invention of the papyrus scroll to the introduction of the e-book, new technologies continuously affect how people view and experience literature. With the advent of digital media, old-media industries, such as the book industry, must find ways to adapt. Some fear that this new technology will destroy the industry, while others maintain that it works to the industry’s advantage. However, one thing is clear—digital technology promises to reshape the publishing industry as we know it.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">E-Books</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01_p01">The first e-book readers were related to the personal digital assistant (PDA) devices, pocket-sized electronics that could store and display large amounts of text, that became popular in the 1990s. However, early e-book readers lingered on the market, popular in certain techy niches but unable to gain traction with the wider population. Early e-readers had minimal battery life and text that was difficult to read. Through the 2000s, technological advances allowed for smaller and sleeker models, the Apple iPhone and the iPad helped make readers more comfortable with reading on a small screen. The second half of the decade saw the release of many e-readers. The technology got a boost when Oprah Winfrey praised the Kindle on her show in October 2008. By that holiday season, e-book reader sales were booming, and it wasn’t just the technologically savvy individuals who were interested anymore. Despite being criticized by some as providing an inferior reading experience to dedicated e-readers, the Apple iPad has been a powerful driving force behind e-book sales—more than 1.5 million books were downloaded on the Apple iPad during its first month of release in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_054">Marion Maneker, “Parsing the iPad’s Book Sale Numbers,” <em class="emphasis">The Big Money</em>, May 4, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/goodnight-gutenberg/2010/05/04/ibooks-vs-app-books-ipad">http://www.thebigmoney.com/blogs/goodnight-gutenberg/2010/05/04/ibooks-vs-app-books-ipad</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01_p02">E-books make up less than 5 percent of the current book market, but that number is growing. At the beginning of 2010, Amazon had about 400,000 titles available for the Kindle device. Some devices offer wireless accessibility, meaning that an e-reader doesn’t have to be connected to a computer to access titles; an open Wi-Fi connection is all it needs. With access to a dazzling array of books available with just a few clicks, it’s no wonder the contemporary consumer seems enamored with the e-book. An e-book reader has the space to store thousands of titles in an object smaller and lighter than the average hardcover novel. And though the devices themselves can be expensive, e-books are usually cheaper than their hardcopy equivalents; sometimes they’re even free. Thanks to efforts like the Gutenberg Project and Google Books (see <a class="xref" href="#lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02">Section 3.5.2 "Digitizing Libraries"</a>), more than a million public domain titles are available as free e-books.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01_p03">Anything that gets people excited about books and reading should be good for the publishing industry, right? Unfortunately for U.S. publishers, it’s not that simple. Some publishers worry that e-book sales may actually end up hurting their bottom lines. During the Kindle’s first year, Amazon essentially set the standard price for bestselling or new release e-books at $9.99. Since Amazon was acting as a wholesaler and buying these books for half the publisher’s list price—generally around $25 for a new hardcover—the company was selling these titles at a loss. However, for Amazon, a short-term loss might have had long-term payoffs. At the start of 2010, the company controlled a 90 percent share of the e-book market. Faced with e-books that cost less than $10, traditional publishers worried that consumers would avoid purchasing a new hardcover priced at $25 (or even a $13 trade paperback).</p>

            <p class="para">Most e-readers are the size and shape of one hardcover book.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01_p04">In January 2010, the conflict between Amazon and the publishing establishment came to a head. Macmillan, one of the six major publishing companies in the United States, suggested a new business model to Amazon, one that resembled the deal that the Big Six publishers had worked out with Apple for e-book sales on the Apple iPad. Essentially, Amazon had been able to buy books from publishers at wholesale rates—half the hardcover list price—and then set whatever retail price it wanted. This allowed Amazon to choose to sell books at a loss in the hope of convincing more people to buy Kindles. Macmillan proposed a system in which Amazon would act more as a commission-earning agent than a wholesaler. In Macmillan’s proposed model, the publisher would set the retail price and take 70 percent of each sale, leaving 30 percent for the retailer. Macmillan couldn’t force Amazon to agree to this deal, but the publisher could strike a hard bargain: If Amazon refused Macmillan’s offer, it could still sell Macmillan titles under the wholesale model, but the publisher would delay e-book editions for 7 months after hardcover releases. What followed was a standoff. Amazon didn’t just reject Macmillan’s proposal; it removed the “buy” button from all Macmillan books listed on its website (including print books), essentially refusing to sell Macmillan titles. However, after a few days, Amazon capitulated and agreed to Macmillan’s terms, but not before issuing a strongly worded press release claiming that they agreed to sell Macmillan’s titles “at prices we believe are needlessly high for e-books,” because “Macmillan has a monopoly over their own titles.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_055">Motoko Rich and Brad Stone, “Publisher Wins Fight With Amazon Over E-books,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 31, 2010, Technology section.</span> Still, Macmillan and the other publishers seem to have won this battle: Amazon agreed that e-books for most new fiction and nonfiction books for adults will be priced at $12.99 to $14.99, though best sellers will still be $9.99.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_056">Motoko Rich and Brad Stone, “Publisher Wins Fight With Amazon Over E-books,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 31, 2010, Technology section.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01_p05">But the $10 book may be the least of the publishing industry’s worries. At the start of 2010, more than half of the bestselling titles on Kindle were free. Some of these were public domain novels such as <em class="emphasis">Pride and Prejudice</em>, but many others were books by living authors being promoted by publishers by giving away the book. The industry hasn’t yet come to a consensus about the utility of free e-books. Some publishers consider it a practice that devalues books in the eyes of customers. “At a time when we are resisting the $9.99 price of e-books,” David Young of the Hachette Book Group told <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>, “it is illogical to give books away for free.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_057">Motoko Rich, “With Kindle, the Best Sellers Don’t Need to Sell,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 23, 2010, Books section.</span> Other publishers consider free e-books a promotional tool to build word-of-mouth and to introduce readers to new authors.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01_p06">Other e-books emerge from outside the traditional publishing system. Four of the five bestselling novels in Japan in 2007 were cell phone novels, books that were both written and intended to be read on cell phones. Cell-phone novels are traditionally written by amateurs who post them on free websites. Readers can download copies at no cost, which means no one is making much of a profit from this new genre. Although the phenomenon has not caught on in the United States yet, the cell phone novel is feared by some publishers as a further sign of the devaluation of books in a world where browsers expect content to be free.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s01_p07">With e-book sales expected to triple by 2015, it’s hard to say what such a quickly growing industry will look like in the future.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_058">James L. McQuivy, “eBook Buying Is About to Spiral Upward,” Forrester Research: Making Leaders Successful Every Day, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/ebook_buying_is_about_to_spiral_upward/q/id/57664/t/2">http://www.forrester.com/rb/Research/ebook_buying_is_about_to_spiral_upward/q/id/57664/t/2</a>.</span> Some people have theorized that e-readers will lead to an increasing popularity of the short story, which can be bought and read in short increments. Others have claimed that they’ll destroy the book industry as we know it. Whatever the future of books looks like, everything—from the way books are produced to the way we read them—continues to change rapidly because of new technologies.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Digitizing Libraries</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p01">The idea of a digitized library has been around since the early years of the Internet. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">digital library</a><span class="glossdef">A library that stores its collections digitally so they are accessible by computer.</span></span> stores its materials in a digital format, accessible by computers. Some digital libraries can be accessed locally; others can be accessed remotely through a computer network. Michael Hart founded Project Gutenberg, the oldest digital library, in 1971, 3 years before the Internet went live. Hart’s initial goal was to make 10,000 of the most-consulted books publicly available and free by the end of the century. The forward-thinking Hart named his project after the inventor of the movable type printing press, perhaps realizing that book digitization had the potential to revolutionize the way humans produce and read books as much as Gutenberg’s invention had centuries earlier. At first, the process was slow for Hart and his fellow book-digitizing volunteers because they were forced to copy text manually until 1989. In the early 1990s, scanners and text-recognition software allowed them to somewhat automate the process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p02">Fast-forward to 2010. Project Gutenberg’s free online library boasts more than 30,000 public domain works available for free download. Stanford University uses a robotic page-turning scanner machine to digitize 1,000 book pages an hour. Stanford’s partner in digital library production is Google Books, which has scanned over 10 million books since it began Google Books in 2004. A Chinese company claims to have digitized more than half of all books that have been published in Chinese since 1949. In 2006, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> estimated that humans have published at least 32 million books throughout history; the huge push for book digitization makes it seem entirely possible that nearly all known books could be digitized within 50 years.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_059">Kevin Kelly, “Scan This Book!” <em class="emphasis">New York Times Magazine</em>, May 14, 2006.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p03">Some liken the prospect of these widely accessible, easily searchable, free libraries to the proliferation of free libraries in the 19th century, which led to a surge in literacy rates. One of Project Gutenberg’s stated goals is “to break down the bars of ignorance and illiteracy” through its library of digitized books.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_060">Michael S. Hart and Gregory B. Newby, “Project Gutenberg Principle of Minimal Regulation,” Project Gutenberg, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Project_Gutenberg_Principle_of_Minimal_Regulation_/_Administration_by_Michael_Hart_and_Greg_Newby">http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Project_Gutenberg_Principle_of_Minimal_Regulation_/_Administration_by_Michael_Hart_and_Greg_Newby</a>.</span> Digital libraries make a huge selection of texts available to people with Internet access, giving them the amazing potential to democratize knowledge. As Bill McCoy, the general manager of Adobe’s e-publishing business, told <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> in 2006, “[s]ome of us have thousands of books at home, can walk to wonderful big-box bookstores and well-stocked libraries and can get <a class="link" href="http://Amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> to deliver next day. The most dramatic effect of digital libraries will be not on us, the well-booked, but on the billions of people worldwide who are underserved by ordinary paper books.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_061">Michael S. Hart and Gregory B. Newby, “Project Gutenberg Principle of Minimal Regulation,” Project Gutenberg, 2004, <a class="link" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Project_Gutenberg_Principle_of_Minimal_Regulation_/_Administration_by_Michael_Hart_and_Greg_Newby">http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Gutenberg:Project_Gutenberg_Principle_of_Minimal_Regulation_/_Administration_by_Michael_Hart_and_Greg_Newby</a>.</span> Digitized libraries can make fragile materials available to browsers without damaging originals; academic libraries are also able to share important texts without shipping books across the country.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p04">Google Books, the largest online library, is not run by an academic institution, though it does claim several as partners. The bulk of free digital books available from Google Books or elsewhere come from the public domain, which constitutes approximately 15 percent of all books. Google Books has made over a million of these titles fully and freely searchable and downloadable. Other works in the Google Books digital library include in-print texts whose publishers have worked out a deal with Google. Some of these titles have their full text available online; others allow only a limited number of page previews. As part of its partnership with publishers, a Google Books search result will often provide links to the publisher’s website and to booksellers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p05">Google Books ran into trouble, however, when it began to digitize the millions of books with unclear legal status, such as out-of-print works that weren’t yet in the public domain. Many of these are considered <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">orphan works</a><span class="glossdef">Works still protected by copyright, but the copyright owner is unknown or difficult to determine.</span></span>, meaning that no one is exactly sure who owns their copyright. In 2004, the site announced plans to scan these texts and to make them searchable, but it would only show sentence-long snippets to searchers. Copyright holders could ask Google to remove these snippets at any time. Google claimed that this digitization plan would benefit authors, whose books would no longer linger in out-of-print limbo; it would also help researchers and readers, who would be able to locate (and perhaps purchase) previously unavailable works.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p06">Publishers and authors did not agree with Google. Many objected to Google’s plan to scan first and look into copyright ownership later; others saw Google’s profiting from works still under copyright as a clear violation of intellectual property law. In 2005, the Authors Guild of America and the American Association of Publishers (AAP) sued Google for “massive copyright infringement.” Google argued that it was essentially creating a massive online card catalog; the Authors Guild and AAP alleged that Google was attempting to monopolize information and profit from it. In 2008, Google agreed to a $125 million settlement with the publishers and the Authors Guild. Some of that money would go directly to copyright holders; some would pay for legal fees; and some would go to found the Book Rights Registry, an independent nonprofit association that would ensure content users (like Google) are paying copyright owners. Copyright owners would get money from Google and from potential book sales; Google would get money from advertisers, book sales, and institutional subscriptions by libraries.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p07">Still, not everyone agreed with the decision. The Open Book Alliance was formed by a diverse partnership of organizations, including Amazon, Internet Archive, and the National Writers Union, who fear that Google’s proprietary control of so much copyrighted material was an antitrust violation. As the group states on its website:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p08">We will assert that any mass book digitization and publishing effort be open and competitive. The process of achieving this promise must be undertaken in the open, grounded in sound public policy and mindful of the need to promote long-term benefits for consumers rather than isolated commercial interests. The Open Book Alliance will counter Google, the Association of American Publishers and the Authors’ [sic] Guild’s scheme to monopolize the access, distribution and pricing of the largest digital database of books in the world.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s02_p09">Another concern, which was mentioned earlier, in the digital library world is digital decay. One librarian at Harvard University told <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> that “[w]e don’t really have any methodology [to preserve digital material] as of yet…. We just store the disks in our climate-controlled stacks, and we’re hoping for some kind of universal Harvard guidelines.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_062">Patricia Cohen, “Fending Off Digital Decay, Bit by Bit,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 15, 2010, Arts section.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Print-on-Demand and Self-Publishing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s03_p01">Part of what made Gutenberg’s printing press so revolutionary was that it allowed books to be mass produced. In medieval times, readers often commissioned a scribe to copy a text by hand, a process that could take months or even years. But despite their many conveniences, printed books carry their own risks for authors and publishers. Producing books in bulk means that publishers are taking a gamble, attempting to publish enough books to satisfy demand, but not so many that unwanted copies linger in warehouses. When a book doesn’t sell as much as expected, the publisher may end up taking a loss if the costs of publishing the book exceed the revenue from its sale. Interestingly, modern technology has made it feasible for some authors and publishers to turn to an updated version of the medieval model of producing books on demand for specific customers, allowing them to avoid the risk of carrying a large inventory of books that may or may not sell. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Print-on-demand</a><span class="glossdef">A printing technology in which new copies of a book are not created until an order is received.</span></span>, a system in which a book is printed only after an order is received, and the increasing trend of self-publishing may reshape the industry in the 21st century.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Self-publishing</a><span class="glossdef">A publishing system in which an author, not a third-party company, is in charge of producing and publishing a work.</span></span>—a system that involves an author, not a third-party company, being in charge of producing and publishing a work—is not a new concept. Many authors self-published works in their lifetimes, including Virginia Woolf and Oscar Wilde. More recently, popular books like <em class="emphasis">The Joy of Cooking</em> and the <em class="emphasis">Chicken Soup for the Soul</em> series had their origins in self-publishing. Many authors also self-publish when they’re unable to get support from the traditional publishing world. Daniel Suarez’s techno-thriller <em class="emphasis">Daemon</em> was rejected by 48 agents before he opted for self-publishing. After creating interest on blogs, Suarez eventually got a two-book deal with Dutton, an imprint of Random House.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_063">Josh McHugh, “How the Self-Published Debut <em class="emphasis">Daemon</em> Earned Serious Geek Cred,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, April 21, 2008.</span> Additionally, self-publishing can be an attractive option for authors who want control over their own content. Instead of leaving decisions up to the publisher, authors can control their own editing, designing, and marketing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s03_p03">One major challenge for authors who choose to strike out on their own is the stigma that’s sometimes attached to self-published books. Until recent years, most self-published authors went through the so-called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">vanity presses</a><span class="glossdef">A pejorative term for a publishing house that publishes books at the author’s expense.</span></span>, which charge writers a premium for published copies of their books. As the name implies, these types of self-publishing ventures were often seen as preying on writers’ need to see their own work in print. To justify the cost of printing, a minimum order of a thousand copies was standard, and unless authors were able to find an audience, they had little hope of selling them all. Because there was no quality control and vanity presses would usually publish anyone with money, some readers were skeptical of self-published books. Major retailers and distributors generally refused to carry them, meaning that authors had to rely on their own marketing efforts to sell the books. Before the advent of the Internet, this usually meant either selling copies in person or relying on mail-order catalogs, neither of which is a very reliable way to sell enough copies to recoup costs.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s03_p04">However, beginning in the early 2000s, self-publishing has changed dramatically. Advances made in publishing technology have made it easier for self-published books to more closely resemble traditionally published ones. Free professional typesetting software has allowed writers to format their text for the page; Adobe Photoshop and similar programs have made image editing and graphic design feasible for amateurs and professionals. The Internet has revolutionized marketing and distribution, allowing authors of books about niche subjects to reach a worldwide audience. As a result, many new Internet-based self-publishing companies have sprung up, offering a variety of services. Some companies, such as Lulu Enterprises and CreateSpace, feature a low-cost service without many bells and whistles; others offer a package of services that may include professional editing, cover design, and marketing. The process has become streamlined as well. For example, to publish a book with Lulu, an author just has to upload a PDF of a properly formatted text file; decide what size, paper, and binding options to use; and make a cover using a premade template. Self-published books are generally quicker to produce and allow an author a higher share of the royalties, though it usually costs more on a per-book basis. As a result, self-published books often have a higher list price.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s03_p05">Whereas vanity publishers were stigmatized for charging authors sometimes thousands of dollars to publish their books, creating a book using the services of Lulu or CreateSpace doesn’t cost the author anything. That’s because users who upload their content aren’t creating an actual, physical copy of a book; instead, they’re essentially making a potential volume. With print-on-demand technology, books aren’t printed until an order is placed, which significantly lowers the financial risk for self-publishers. Print-on-demand is especially useful for books with a limited or niche audience. Print-on-demand isn’t only being used by self-publishers; both small presses and academic publishers are using the technology for older books without much of an audience. With print-on-demand, books that may only sell a few dozen copies a year can stay in print without the publisher having to worry about printing a full run of copies and being stuck with unsold inventory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch03_s05_s03_p06">Although some self-published authors manage to find a huge audience, most don’t. Bob Young, the founder of Lulu, told the <em class="emphasis">London Times</em> that his goal is to publish 1 million books that each sell 100 copies, rather than 100 books that sell 1 million copies each.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn03_064">Damian Whitworth, “Publish and Be Downloaded,” <em class="emphasis">Times</em> (London), March 8, 2006, Life and Style section.</span> Lulu and other enterprising self-publishers disrupt the traditional notion of the publishing house, which acted as a sort of gatekeeper for the book industry—ushering a few talented, lucky writers in and keeping others out. In the world of self-publishing, there are no barriers—anyone with a book in a PDF file can whip up a nice-looking paperback in under 1 hour. This has democratized the industry, allowing writers who had been rejected by the traditional publishers to find their own audience. But it has also meant that a lot of writing with little literary merit has been published as well. Additionally, if a bestseller in the Lulu world is a book that sells 500 copies, as Bob Young told the <em class="emphasis">London Times</em>, then few authors are going to be able to make a living through self-publishing. Indeed, most of the self-publishing success stories involve writers whose self-published efforts sold well enough to get them a book deal with one of the traditional publishing houses, a sign that for better or for worse, the traditional publishing model still has the social cachet and sales to dominate the industry.</p>

                <li>E-books have been increasing in popularity with customers since the 1990s. However, the publishing industry is worried that setting the price for e-books at $9.99, as Amazon initially did for most titles, would turn consumers away from buying more expensive physical books. Amazon lost money on every $9.99 e-book but hoped that the low prices would act as an incentive to buy its e-book reader, the Kindle device. In 2010, Macmillan and other publishers forced Amazon to change its pricing model to give publishers more control over e-book prices.</li>
                <li>Digital libraries began with Project Gutenberg in 1971. Digitized books allow anyone with an Internet connection access to millions of volumes, and some advocates hope that digital libraries will lead to a rise in global literacy rates. Millions of books in the public domain are available for free download. Google Books, the largest digital library, has run into trouble with its plan to digitize as many books as possible, even books under current copyright. The Open Book Alliance accuses Google of monopolizing copyrighted content to make a profit.</li>
                <li>Self-publishing used to carry a social stigma as well as a high cost. Thanks to print-on-demand services, self-publishing is an increasingly popular option for amateur and professional writers. It appeals to authors who may have a niche audience or who want more control over their work. Print-on-demand makes it possible for books to never go out of print.</li>

                <li>One of the initial intentions of copyright law was to protect artists while also allowing a free market of ideas.
