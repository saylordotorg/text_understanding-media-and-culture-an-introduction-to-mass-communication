However, the precursors to modern video games were created as early as the 1950s. In 1952 a computer simulation of tic-tac-toe was developed for EDSAC, one of the first stored-information computers, and in 1958 a game called <em class="emphasis">Tennis for Two</em> was developed at Brookhaven National Laboratory as a way to entertain people coming through the laboratory on tours.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_004">Simon Egenfeldt-Nielsen, <em class="emphasis">Understanding Video Games: The Essential Introduction</em> (New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 2008), 50.</span></p>

Games like <em class="emphasis">Space Invaders</em> illustrate both the effect of arcade games and their influence on international culture. In two different countries on opposite sides of the globe, Japanese and American teenagers, although they could not speak to one another, were having the same experiences thanks to a video game.</p>

This system included a <em class="emphasis">Pong</em>-type game, and when the arcade version of <em class="emphasis">Pong</em> became popular, the Odyssey began to sell well. Atari, which was making arcade games at the time, decided to produce a home version of <em class="emphasis">Pong</em> and released it in 1974. Although this system could only play one game, its graphics and controls were superior to the Odyssey, and it was sold through a major department store, Sears. Because of these advantages, the Atari home version of <em class="emphasis">Pong</em> sold well, and a host of other companies began producing and selling their own versions of <em class="emphasis">Pong</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_007">Leonard Herman, “Early Home Video Game Systems,” in <em class="emphasis">The Video Game Explosion: From Pong to PlayStation and Beyond</em>, ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s02_p02">A major step forward in the evolution of video games was the development of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">game cartridges</a><span class="glossdef">Interchangeable cartridges containing video games for use in home consoles.</span></span> that stored the games and could be interchanged in the console. With this technology, users were no longer limited to a set number of games, leading many video game console makers to switch their emphasis to producing games. Several groups, such as Magnavox, Coleco, and Fairchild, released versions of cartridge-type consoles, but Atari’s 2600 console had the upper hand because of the company’s work on arcade games. Atari capitalized off of its arcade successes by releasing games that were well known to a public that was frequenting arcades. The popularity of games such as <em class="emphasis">Space Invaders</em> and <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> made the Atari 2600 a successful system. The late 1970s also saw the birth of companies such as Activision, which developed third-party games for the Atari 2600.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_008">Mark J. P.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s03_p01">The birth of the home computer market in the 1970s paralleled the emergence of video game consoles. The first computer designed and sold for the home consumer was the Altair. It was first sold in 1975, several years after video game consoles had been selling, and it sold mainly to a hobbyist market. During this period, people such as Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple, were building computers by hand and selling them to get their start-up businesses going. In 1977, three important computers—Radio Shack’s TRS-80, the Commodore PET, and the Apple II—were produced and began selling to the home market.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_009">Jeremy Reimer, “Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures,” <em class="emphasis">Ars Technica</em> (blog), December 14, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/total-share.ars/2">http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/12/total-share.ars/2</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s01_s03_p02">The rise of personal computers allowed for the development of more complex games. Designers of games such as <em class="emphasis">Mystery House</em>, developed in 1979 for the Apple II, and <em class="emphasis">Rogue</em>, developed in 1980 and played on IBM PCs, used the processing power of early home computers to develop video games that had extended plots and story lines. In these games, players moved through landscapes composed of basic graphics, solving problems and working through an involved narrative. The development of video games for the personal computer platform expanded the ability of video games to act as media by allowing complex stories to be told and new forms of interaction to take place between players.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p01">Atari’s success in the home console market was due in large part to its ownership of already-popular arcade games and the large number of game cartridges available for the system. These strengths, however, eventually proved detrimental to the company and led to what is now known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">video game crash of 1983</a><span class="glossdef">The economic failure of the video game industry in 1983, caused by an oversupply of games and waning demand.</span></span>. Atari bet heavily on its past successes with popular arcade games by releasing <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> for the Atari 2600. <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> was a successful arcade game that did not translate well to the home console, leading to disappointed consumers and lower-than-expected sales. Additionally, Atari produced 10 million of the lackluster <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> games on its first run, despite the fact that active consoles were only estimated at 10 million. Similar mistakes were made with a game based on the movie <em class="emphasis">E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</em>, which has gained notoriety as one of the worst games in Atari’s history. It was not received well by consumers despite the success of the movie, and Atari had again bet heavily on its success. Piles of unsold <em class="emphasis">E.T.</em> game cartridges were reportedly buried in the New Mexico desert under a veil of secrecy.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_010">Nick Montfort and Ian Bogost, <em class="emphasis">Racing the Beam</em>: <em class="emphasis">The Atari Video Computer System</em> (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009), 127.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_p02">As retail outlets became increasingly wary of home console failures, they began stocking fewer games on shelves. This action, combined with an increasing number of companies producing games, led to overproduction and a resulting fallout in the video game market in 1983. Many smaller game developers did not have the capacity to withstand this downturn and went out of business. Although Coleco and Atari were able to make it through the crash, neither company regained its former share of the video game market. It was 1985 when the video game market picked up again.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_011">Steven Kent, “Super Mario Nation,” <em class="emphasis">American Heritage</em>, September 1997, <a class="link" href="http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1997/5/1997_5_65.shtml">http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1997/5/1997_5_65.shtml</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p01">Nintendo, a Japanese card and novelty producer that had begun to produce electronic games in the 1970s, was responsible for arcade games such as <em class="emphasis">Donkey Kong</em> in the early 1980s. Its first home console, developed in 1984 for sale in Japan, tried to succeed where Atari had failed. The Nintendo system used newer, better microchips, bought in large quantities, to ensure high-quality graphics at a price consumers could afford. Keeping console prices low meant Nintendo had to rely on games for most of its profits and maintain control of game production. This was something Atari had failed to do, and it led to a glut of low-priced games that caused the crash of 1983. Nintendo got around this problem with proprietary circuits that would not allow unlicensed games to be played on the console. This allowed Nintendo to dominate the home video game market through the end of the decade, when one-third of homes in the United States had a Nintendo system.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_012">Gary Cross and Gregory Smits, “Japan, the U.S. and the Globalization of Children’s Consumer Culture,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Social History</em> 38, no. 4 (2005).</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p02">Nintendo introduced its Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in the United States in 1985. The game <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Brothers</em>, released with the system, was also a landmark in video game development. The game employed a narrative in the same manner as more complicated computer games, but its controls were accessible and its objectives simple. The game appealed to a younger demographic, generally boys in the 8–14 range, than the one targeted by Atari.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_013">Stephen Kline, Nick Dyer-Witheford, and Greig De Peuter, <em class="emphasis">Digital Play: The Interaction of Technology, Culture, and Marketing</em> (Montreal: McGill-Queen’s University Press, 2003), 119.</span> Its designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, tried to mimic the experiences of childhood adventures, creating a fantasy world not based on previous models of science fiction or other literary genres.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_014">Rus McLaughlin, “IGN Presents the History of Super Mario Bros.,” <em class="emphasis">IGN Retro</em>, November 8, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://games.ign.com/articles/833/833615p1.html">http://games.ign.com/articles/833/833615p1.html</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Brothers</em> also gave Nintendo an iconic character who has been used in numerous other games, television shows, and even a movie. The development of this type of character and fantasy world became the norm for video game makers. Games such as <em class="emphasis">The Legend of Zelda</em> became franchises with film and television possibilities rather than simply one-off games.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s01_p03">As video games developed as a form of media, the public struggled to come to grips with the kind of messages this medium was passing on to children. These were no longer simple games of reflex that could be compared to similar non-video games or sports; these were forms of media that included stories and messages that concerned parents and children’s advocates. Arguments about the larger meaning of the games became common, with some seeing the games as driven by ideas of conquest and gender stereotypes, whereas others saw basic stories about traveling and exploration.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_015">Mary Fuller and Henry Jenkins, “Nintendo and New World Travel Writing: A Dialogue,” <em class="emphasis">Cybersociety: Computer-Mediated Communication and Community</em>, ed.

Atari released the 2600jr and the 7800 in 1986 after Nintendo’s success, but the consoles could not compete with Nintendo. The Sega Corporation, which had been involved with arcade video game production, released its Sega Master System in 1986.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p01">The enormous number of games available for Atari consoles in the early 1980s took its toll on video arcades. In 1983, arcade revenues had fallen to a 3-year low, leading game makers to turn to newer technologies that could not be replicated by home consoles. This included arcade games powered by laser discs, such as <em class="emphasis">Dragon’s Lair</em> and <em class="emphasis">Space Ace</em>, but their novelty soon wore off, and laser-disc games became museum pieces.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_017">Aljean Harmetz, “Video Arcades Turn to Laser Technology as Queues Dwindle,” <em class="emphasis">Morning Herald</em> (Sydney), February 2, 1984.</span> In 1989, museums were already putting on exhibitions of early arcade games that included ones from the early 1980s. Although newer games continued to come out on arcade platforms, they could not compete with the home console market and never achieved their previous successes from the early 1980s. Increasingly, arcade gamers chose to stay at home to play games on computers and consoles. Today, dedicated arcades are a dying breed. Most that remain, like the Dave &amp; Buster’s and Chuck E. Cheese’s chains, offer full-service restaurants and other entertainment attractions to draw in business.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s02_s02_p02">Home games fared better than arcades because they could ride the wave of personal computer purchases that occurred in the 1980s. Some important developments in video games occurred in the mid-1980s with the development of online games. Multiuser dungeons, or MUDs, were role-playing games played online by multiple users at once. The games were generally text-based, describing the world of the MUD through text rather than illustrating it through graphics. The games allowed users to create a character and move through different worlds, accomplishing goals that awarded them with new skills. If characters attained a certain level of proficiency, they could then design their own area of the world. <em class="emphasis">Habitat</em>, a game developed in 1986 for the Commodore 64, was a graphic version of this type of game. Users dialed up on modems to a central host server and then controlled characters on screen, interacting with other users. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_018">Jeremy Reimer, “The Evolution of Gaming: Computers, Consoles, and Arcade,” <em class="emphasis">Ars Technica</em> (blog), October 10, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/10/gaming-evolution.ars/4">http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2005/10/gaming-evolution.ars/4</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s01_p02">The Sega Master System had failed to challenge the NES, but with the release of its 16-bit system, Sega Genesis, the company pursued a new marketing strategy. Whereas Nintendo targeted 8- to 14-year-olds, Sega’s marketing plan targeted 15- to 17-year olds, making games that were more mature and advertising during programs such as the MTV Video Music Awards. The campaign successfully branded Sega as a cooler version of Nintendo and moved mainstream video games into a more mature arena. Nintendo responded to the Sega Genesis with its own 16-bit system, the Super NES, and began creating more mature games as well. Games such as Sega’s <em class="emphasis">Mortal Kombat</em> and Nintendo’s <em class="emphasis">Street Fighter</em> competed to raise the level of violence possible in a video game. Sega’s advertisements even suggested that its game was better because of its more violent possibilities.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_021">Gamespot, “When Two Tribes Go to War: A History of Video Game Controversy,” <a class="link" href="http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/p-5.html">http://www.gamespot.com/features/6090892/p-5.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s01_p03">By 1994, companies such as 3DO, with its 32-bit system, and Atari, with its allegedly 64-bit Jaguar, attempted to get in on the home console market but failed to use effective marketing strategies to back up their products. Both systems fell out of production before the end of the decade. Sega, fearing that its system would become obsolete, released the 32-bit Saturn system in 1995. The system was rushed into production and did not have enough games available to ensure its success.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_022"><a class="link" href="http://CyberiaPC.com">CyberiaPC.com</a>, “Sega Saturn (History, Specs, Pictures),” <a class="link" href="http://www.cyberiapc.com/vgg/sega_saturn.htm">http://www.cyberiapc.com/vgg/sega_saturn.htm</a>.</span> Sony stepped in with its PlayStation console at a time when Sega’s Saturn was floundering and before Nintendo’s 64-bit system had been released. This system targeted an even older demographic of 14- to 24-year-olds and made a large effect on the market; by March of 2007, Sony had sold 102 million PlayStations.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_023">Edge staff, “The Making Of: Playstation,” <em class="emphasis">Edge</em>, April 24, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-playstation">http://www.next-gen.biz/features/the-making-of-playstation</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s04_p01">The development of portable game systems was another important aspect of video games during the 1990s. Handheld games had been in use since the 1970s, and a system with interchangeable cartridges had even been sold in the early 1980s. Nintendo released the Game Boy in 1989, using the same principles that made the NES dominate the handheld market throughout the 1990s. The Game Boy was released with the game <em class="emphasis">Tetris</em>, using the game’s popularity to drive purchases of the unit. The unit’s simple design meant users could get 20 hours of playing time on a set of batteries, and this basic design was left essentially unaltered for most of the decade. More advanced handheld systems, such as the Atari Lynx and Sega Game Gear, could not compete with the Game Boy despite their superior graphics and color displays. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_026">Joe Hutsko, “88 Million and Counting; Nintendo Remains King of the Handheld Game Players,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 25, 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s03_s04_p02">The decade-long success of the Game Boy belies the conventional wisdom of the console wars that more advanced technology makes for a more popular system. The Game Boy’s static, simple design was readily accessible, and its stability allowed for a large library of games to be developed for it. Despite using technology almost a decade old, the Game Boy accounted for 30 percent of Nintendo of America’s overall revenues at the end of the 1990s. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_027">Joe Hutsko, “88 Million and Counting; Nintendo Remains King of the Handheld Game Players,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, March 25, 2000, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/25/business/88-million-and-counting-nintendo-remains-king-of-the-handheld-game-players.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_s01_p01">1999 saw Sega’s last effort in the console wars with its Sega Dreamcast. This console could connect to the Internet, emulating the sophisticated computer games of the 1990s. The new features of the Sega Dreamcast were not enough to save the brand, however, and Sega discontinued production in 2001, leaving the console market entirely.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_028">“Sega Dreamcast,” slide in “A Brief History of Game Console Warfare,” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, <a class="link" href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/">http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_s01_p02">A major problem for Sega’s Dreamcast was Sony’s release of the PlayStation 2 (PS2) in 2000. The PS2 could function as a DVD player, expanding the role of the console into an entertainment device that did more than play video games. This console was incredibly successful, enjoying a long production run, with more than 106 million units sold worldwide by the end of the decade.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_029">“PlayStation 2,” slide in “A Brief History of Game Console Warfare.” <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em>, <a class="link" href="http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/">http://images.businessweek.com/ss/06/10/game_consoles/</a></span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_s01_p03">In 2001, two major consoles were released to compete with the PS2: the Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube. The Xbox was an attempt by Microsoft to enter the market with a console that expanded on the functions of other game consoles. The unit had features similar to a PC, including a hard drive and an ethernet port for online play through its service, Xbox Live. The popularity of the first-person shooter game <em class="emphasis">Halo</em>, an Xbox exclusive release, boosted sales as well. Nintendo’s GameCube did not offer DVD playback capabilities, choosing instead to focus on gaming functions. Both of these consoles sold millions of units but did not come close to the sales of the PS2.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s01_s04_s02_p01">As consoles developed to rival the capabilities of personal computers, game developers began to focus more on games for consoles. From 2000 to the end of the decade, the popularity of personal computer games has gradually declined. The computer gaming community, while still significant, is focused on game players who are willing to pay a lot of money on personal computers that are designed specifically for gaming, often including multiple monitors and user modifications that allow personal computers to play newer games. This type of market, though profitable, is not large enough to compete with the audience for the much cheaper game consoles. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_030">Kristin Kalning, “Is PC Gaming Dying?

In 2004, anticipating Sony’s upcoming handheld console, Nintendo released the Nintendo DS, a handheld console that featured two screens and Wi-Fi capabilities for online gaming.

The N-Gage was a combination of a game console and mobile phone that, according to consumers, did not fill either role very well. The product line was discontinued in 2005, but the idea of playing games on phones persisted and has been developed on other platforms.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_032">Brad Stone, “Play It Again, Nokia.

The release of Microsoft’s Xbox 360 led this generation of consoles in 2005. The Xbox 360 featured expanded media capabilities and integrated access to Xbox Live, an online gaming service. Sony’s PlayStation 3 (PS3) was released in 2006. It also featured enhanced online access as well as expanded multimedia functions, with the additional capacity to play Blu-ray discs. Nintendo released the Wii at the same time. This console featured a motion-sensitive controller that departed from previous controllers and focused on accessible, often family-oriented games. This combination successfully brought in large numbers of new game players, including many older adults. By June 2010, in the United States, the Wii had sold 71.9 million units, the Xbox 360 had sold 40.3 million, and the PS3 trailed at 35.4 million.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_034">VGChartz, “Weekly Hardware Chart: 19th June 2010,” <a class="link" href="http://www.vgchartz.com">http://www.vgchartz.com</a>.</span> In the wake of the Wii’s success, Microsoft and Sony have introduced their own motion-sensitive systems.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_035">J.
