    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_p01">An NPD poll conducted in 2007 found that 72 percent of the U.S. population had played a video game that year.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_048">Chris Faylor, “NPD: 72% of U.S. Population Played Games in 2007; PC Named “Driving Force in Online Gaming,” Shack News, April 2, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52025">http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52025</a>.</span> The increasing number of people playing video games means that video games are having an undeniable effect on culture. This effect is clearly visible in the increasing mainstream acceptance of aspects of gaming culture. Video games have also changed the way that many other forms of media, from music to film, are produced and consumed. Education has also been changed by video games through the use of new technologies that help teachers and students communicate in new ways through educational games such as <em class="emphasis">Brain Age</em>. As video games have an increasing influence on our culture, many have voiced their opinions on whether this form of media should be considered an art.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Game Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p01">To fully understand the effects of video games on mainstream culture, it is important to understand the development of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gaming culture</a><span class="glossdef">The unique set of aesthetics and principles that characterize video games.</span></span>, or the culture surrounding video games. Video games, like books or movies, have avid users who have made this form of media central to their lives. In the early 1970s, programmers got together in groups to play <em class="emphasis">Spacewar!</em>, spending a great deal of time competing in a game that was rudimentary compared to modern games.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_049">Stewart Brand, “Space War,” <em class="emphasis">Rolling Stone</em>, December 7, 1972.</span> As video arcades and home video game consoles gained in popularity, youth culture quickly adapted to this type of media, engaging in competitions to gain high scores and spending hours at the arcade or with the home console.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p02">In the 1980s, an increasing number of kids were spending time on consoles playing games and, more importantly, increasingly identifying with the characters and products associated with the games. Saturday morning cartoons were made out of the <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em> and <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Bros.</em> games, and an array of nongame merchandise was sold with video game logos and characters. The public recognition of some of these characters has made them into cultural icons. A poll taken in 2007 found that more Canadians surveyed could identify a photo of Mario, from <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Bros.</em>, than a photo of the current Canadian prime minister.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_050">Cohn &amp; Wolfe Toronto, “Italian Plumber More Memorable Than Harper, Dion,” news release, November 13, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/mmnr/Super_Mario_Galaxy/index.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p03">As the kids who first played <em class="emphasis">Super Mario Bros.</em> began to outgrow video games, companies such as Sega, and later Sony and Microsoft, began making games to appeal to older demographics.

            <h3 class="title">The Subculture of Geeks</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p04">The acceptance of video games in mainstream culture has consequently changed the way that the culture views certain people. “Geek” was the name given to people who were adept at technology but lacking in the skills that tended to make one popular, like fashion sense or athletic ability. Many of these people, because they often did not fare well in society, favored imaginary worlds such as those found in the fantasy and science fiction genres. Video games were appealing because they were both a fantasy world and a means to excel at something. Jim Rossignol, in his 2008 book <em class="emphasis">This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities</em>, explained part of the lure of playing <em class="emphasis">Quake III</em> online:</p>
            <span class="blockquote">
                <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p05">Cold mornings, adolescent disinterest, and a nagging hip injury had meant that I was banished from the sports field for many years. I wasn’t going to be able to indulge in the camaraderie that sports teams felt or in the extended buzz of victory through dedication and cooperation. That entire swathe of experience had been cut off from me by cruel circumstance and a good dose of self-defeating apathy. Now, however, there was a possibility for some kind of redemption: a sport for the quick-fingered and the computer-bound; a space of possibility in which I could mold friends and strangers into a proficient gaming team.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_053">Jim Rossignol, <em class="emphasis">This Gaming Life: Travels in Three Cities</em> (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2008), 17.</span></p>
            </span>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p06">Video games gave a group of excluded people a way to gain proficiency in the social realm. As video games became more of a mainstream phenomenon and video game skills began to be desired by a large number of people, the popular idea of geeks changed. It is now common to see the term “geek” used to mean a person who understands computers and technology. This former slur is also prominent in the media, with headlines in 2010 such as “Geeks in Vogue: Top Ten Cinematic Nerds.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_054">Craig Sharp, “Geeks in Vogue: Top Ten Cinematic Nerds,” <em class="emphasis">Film Shaft</em>, April 26, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.filmshaft.com/geeks-in-vogue-top-ten-cinematic-nerds/">http://www.filmshaft.com/geeks-in-vogue-top-ten-cinematic-nerds/</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s01_p07">Many media stories focusing on geeks examine the ways in which this subculture has been accepted by the mainstream. Geeks may have become “cooler,” but mainstream culture has also become “geekier.” The acceptance of geek culture has led to acceptance of geek aesthetics. The mainstreaming of video games has led to acceptance of fantasy or virtual worlds. This is evident in the popularity of film/book series such as The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. Comic book characters, emblems of geek culture, have become the vehicles for blockbuster movies such as <em class="emphasis">Spider-Man</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Dark Knight</em>. The idea of a fantasy or virtual world has come to appeal to greater numbers of people. Virtual worlds such as those represented in the <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em class="emphasis">Halo</em> series and online games such as <em class="emphasis">World of Warcraft</em> have expanded the idea of virtual worlds so that they are not mere means of escape but new ways to interact.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_055">Lars Konzack, “Geek Culture: The 3rd Counter-Culture,” (paper, FNG2006, Preston, England, June 26–28, 2006), <a class="link" href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/270364/Geek-Culture-The-3rd-CounterCulture">http://www.scribd.com/doc/270364/Geek-Culture-The-3rd-CounterCulture</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Effects of Video Games on Other Types of Media</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_p01">Video games during the 1970s and 1980s were often <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">derivatives</a><span class="glossdef">Media that uses the narratives and aesthetics of other forms of media.</span></span> of other forms of media. <em class="emphasis">E.T.</em>, <em class="emphasis">Star Wars</em>, and a number of other games took their cues from movies, television shows, and books. This began to change in the 1980s with the development of cartoons based on video games, and in the 1990s and 2000s with live-action feature films based on video games.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Television</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p01">Television programs based on video games were an early phenomenon. <em class="emphasis">Pac-Man</em>, <em class="emphasis">Pole Position</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Q*bert</em> were among the animated programs that aired in the early 1980s. In the later 1980s, shows such as <em class="emphasis">The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Legend of Zelda</em> promoted Nintendo games. In the 1990s, <em class="emphasis">Pokémon</em>, originally a game developed for the Nintendo Game Boy, was turned into a television series, a card game, several movies, and even a musical.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_056">Internet Move Database, “Pokémon,” <a class="link" href="http://www.imdb.com/">http://www.imdb.com/</a>.</span> Recently, several programs have been developed that revolve entirely around video games—the web series <em class="emphasis">The Guild</em>, for instance, tells the story of a group of friends who interact through an unspecified MMORPG.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p02">Nielsen, the company that tabulates television ratings, has begun rating video games in a similar fashion. In 2010, this information showed that video games, as a whole, could be considered a kind of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fifth network</a><span class="glossdef">Term used to describe the potential for video games to rival the top four television networks.</span></span>, along with the television networks NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_057">Mike Shields, “Nielsen: Video Games Approach 5th Network Status,” <em class="emphasis">Adweek</em>, March 25, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/agency/e3i4f087b1aeac6f008d0ecadfeffe4a191">http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/agency/e3i4f087b1aeac6f008d0ecadfeffe4a191</a>.</span> Advertisers use Nielsen ratings to decide which programs to support. The use of this system is changing public perceptions to include video game playing as a habit similar to television watching.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s01_p03">Video games have also influenced the way that television is produced. The Rocket Racing League, scheduled to be launched in 2011, will feature a “virtual racetrack.” Racing jets will travel along a virtual track that can only be seen by pilots and spectators with enabled equipment. Applications for mobile devices are being developed that will allow spectators to race virtual jets alongside the ones flying in real time.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_058">Adam Hadhazy, “’NASCAR of the Skies’ to Feature Video Game-Like Interactivity,” <em class="emphasis">TechNewsDaily</em>, April 26, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.technewsdaily.com/nascar-of-the-skies-to-feature-video-game-like-interactivity%E2%80%930475/">http://www.technewsdaily.com/nascar-of-the-skies-to-feature-video-game-like-interactivity–0475/</a>.</span> This type of innovation is only possible with a public that has come to demand and rely on the kind of interactivity that video games provide.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p01">The rise in film adaptations of video games accompanies the increased age of video game users. In 1995, <em class="emphasis">Mortal Kombat</em>, a live-action movie based on the video game, grossed over $70 million at the box office, placing it 22nd in the rankings for that year.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_059">Box Office Mojo, “Mortal Kombat,” <a class="link" href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mortalkombat.htm">http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mortalkombat.htm</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</em>, released in 2001, starred well-known actress Angelina Jolie and ranked No. 1 at the box office when it was released, and 15th overall for the year.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_060">Box Office Mojo, “Lara Croft: Tomb Raider,” <a class="link" href="http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tombraider.htm">http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tombraider.htm</a>.</span> Films based on video games are an increasingly common sight at the box office, such as producer Jerry Bruckheimer’s <em class="emphasis">Prince of Persia</em>, or the recent sequel to <em class="emphasis">Tron</em>, based on the idea of a virtual gaming arena.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s02_p02">Another aspect of video games’ influence on films is how video game releases are marketed and perceived. The release date for anticipated game <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto IV</em> was announced and marketed to compete with the release of the film <em class="emphasis">Iron Man</em>. <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto IV</em> supposedly beat <em class="emphasis">Iron Man</em> by $300,000,000 million in sales. This kind of comparison is, in some ways, misleading. Video games cost much more than a ticket to a movie, so higher sales does not mean that more people bought the game than the movie. Also, the distribution apparatus for the two media is totally different. Movies can only be released in theaters, whereas video games can be sold at any retail outlet.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_061">Associated Press, “‘Grand Theft Auto IV’ Beats ‘Iron Man’ by $300 Million,” <em class="emphasis">Fox News</em>, May 9, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354711,00.html">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,354711,00.html</a>.</span> What this kind of news story proves, however, is that the general public considers video games as something akin to a film. It is also important to realize that the scale of production and profit for video games is similar to that of films. Video games include music scores, actors, and directors in addition to the game designers, and the budgets for major games reflect this. <em class="emphasis">Grand Theft Auto IV</em> cost an estimated $100 million to produce.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_062">Gillian Bowditch, “Grand Theft Auto Producer is Godfather of Gaming,” <em class="emphasis">Times</em> (London), April 27, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3821838.ece">http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article3821838.ece</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p01">Video games have been accompanied by music ever since the days of the arcade. Video game music was originally limited to computer beeps turned into theme songs. The design of the Nintendo 64, Sega Saturn, and Sony PlayStation made it possible to use sampled audio on new games, meaning songs played on physical instruments could be recorded and used on video games. Beginning with the music of the <em class="emphasis">Final Fantasy</em> series, scored by famed composer Nobuo Uematsu, video game music took on film score quality, complete with full orchestral and vocal tracks. This innovation proved beneficial to the music industry. Well-known musicians such as Trent Reznor, Thomas Dolby, Steve Vai, and Joe Satriani were able to create the soundtracks for popular games, giving these artists exposure to new generations of potential fans.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_063">“Video Games Music Big Hit,” <em class="emphasis">Wilmington (NC) Morning Star</em>, February 1, 1997, 36.</span> Composing music for video games has turned into a profitable means of employment for many musicians. Schools such as Berklee College of Music, Yale, and New York University have programs that focus on composing music for video games. The students are taught many of the same principles that are involved in film scoring.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_064">Joseph P. Khan, “Berklee is Teaching Its Students to Compose Scores for Video Games,” <em class="emphasis">Boston Globe</em>, January 19, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/01/19/berklee_is_teaching_students_to_compose_scores_for_video_games/">http://www.boston.com/news/education/higher/articles/2010/01/19/berklee_is_teaching_students_to_compose_scores_for_video_games/</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p02">Many rock bands have allowed their previously recorded songs to be used in video games, similar to a hit song being used on a movie soundtrack. The bands are paid for the rights to use the song, and their music is exposed to an audience that otherwise might not hear it. As mentioned earlier, games like <em class="emphasis">Rock Band</em> and <em class="emphasis">Guitar Hero</em> have been used to promote bands. The release of <em class="emphasis">The Beatles: Rock Band</em> was timed to coincide with the release of digitally remastered reissues of the Beatles’ albums.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s02_s03_p03">Another phenomenon relating to music and video games involves musicians covering video game music. A number of bands perform only video game covers in a variety of styles, such as the popular Japanese group the Black Mages, which performs rock versions of <em class="emphasis">Final Fantasy</em> music. Playing video game themes is not limited to rock bands, however. An orchestra and chorus called Video Games Live started a tour in 2005 dedicated to playing well-known video game music. Their performances are often accompanied by graphics projected onto a screen showing relevant sequences from the video games.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_065">Jason Michael Paul Productions, “About,” Play!

Although these early movies were released only online and targeted a select niche of gamers, professional filmmakers have since adopted the process, using machinima to storyboard scenes and to add a sense of individuality to computer-generated shots.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p02">Other educational institutions have begun to embrace video games as well. The Boy Scouts of America have created a “belt loop,” something akin to a merit badge, for tasks including learning to play a parent-approved game and developing a schedule to balance video game time with homework.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_069">David Murphy, “Boy Scouts Develop ‘Vide Game’ Merit Badge,” <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>, May 2, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363331,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363331,00.asp</a>.</span> The federal government has also seen the educational potential of video games. A commission on balancing the federal budget suggested a video game that would educate Americans about the necessary costs of balancing the federal budget.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_070">Richard Wolf, “Nation’s Soaring Deficit Calls for Painful Choices,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, April 14, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-04-12-deficit_N.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-04-12-deficit_N.htm</a>.</span> The military has similarly embraced video games as training simulators for new soldiers. These simulators, working off of newer game technologies, present several different realistic options that soldiers could face on the field. The games have also been used as recruiting tools by the U.S. Army and the Army National Guard.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_071">Associated Press, “Military Training Is Just a Game,” <em class="emphasis">Wired</em>, October 3, 2003, <a class="link" href="http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2003/10/60688">http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/news/2003/10/60688</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s03_p03">The ultimate effect of video game use for education, whether in schools or in the public arena, means that video games have been validated by established cultural authorities. Many individuals still resist the idea that video games can be beneficial or have a positive cultural influence, but their embrace by educational institutions has given video games validation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s04_p01">While universally accepted as a form of media, a debate has recently arisen over whether video games can be considered a form of art. Roger Ebert, the well-known film critic, has historically argued that “video games can never be art,” citing the fact that video games are meant to be won, whereas art is meant to be experienced.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_072">Roger Ebert, “Video Games Can Never Be Art,” <em class="emphasis">Chicago Sun-Times</em>, April 16, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html">http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/04/video_games_can_never_be_art.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s04_p02">His remarks have generated an outcry from both video gamers and developers. Many point to games such as 2009’s <em class="emphasis">Flower</em>, in which players control the flow of flower petals in the wind, as examples of video games developing into art. <em class="emphasis">Flower</em> avoids specific plot and characters to allow the player to focus on interaction with the landscape and the emotion of the game-play.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_073">That Game Company, “Flower,” <a class="link" href="http://thatgamecompany.com/games/flower/">http://thatgamecompany.com/games/flower/</a>.</span> Likewise, more mainstream games such as the popular Katamari series, released in 2004, are built around the idea of creation, requiring players to pull together a massive clump of objects in order to create a star.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch10_s03_s04_p03">Video games, once viewed as a mindless source of entertainment, are now being featured in publications such as <em class="emphasis">The New Yorker</em> magazine and <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em>.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn10_074">Max Fisher, “Are Video Games Art?” <em class="emphasis">Atlantic Wire</em>, April 19, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Are-Video-Games-Art-1085/">http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Are-Video-Games-Art-1085/</a>.</span> With the development of increasingly complex musical scores and the advent of machinima, the boundaries between video games and other forms of media are slowly blurring. While they may not be considered art by everyone, video games have contributed significantly to modern artistic culture.</p>
