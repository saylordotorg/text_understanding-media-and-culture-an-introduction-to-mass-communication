    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_p01">Magazines have evolved significantly since their inception. Magazines have affected the world by bringing news, entertainment, literature, and photography to their readers. Additionally, the magazine industry has profoundly affected U.S. popular culture. As magazines have developed over time, individual publications have targeted specific groups and have found particular niches. This section explores a number of popular periodicals and their effect on their target audiences.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">News Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p01">As discussed in <a class="xref" href="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01#lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01">Section 5.1 "History of Magazine Publishing"</a>, newsmagazines became popular during the 1920s. Today, newsmagazines make up a large portion of magazine sales, with multiple news periodicals ranking in the top 30 for circulation. Over time, a number of newsmagazines have established themselves in the industry, including <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, and <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block"><em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em></h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>’s initial February 1933 issue was called <em class="emphasis">News-Week</em> and featured seven different photographs from the week’s news on its cover. The weekly publication currently “offers comprehensive coverage of world events with a global network of correspondents, reporters and editors covering national and international affairs, business, science and technology, society and the arts and entertainment.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_039"><em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, “History of <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>,” <a class="link" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2007/10/10/history-of-newsweek.html">http://www.newsweek.com/2007/10/10/history-of-newsweek.html</a>.</span> Relying on a wide array of reporters, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> also uniquely publishes a reader-penned section titled “My Turn.” The magazine has been hugely successful over the years and holds more prestigious National Magazine Awards than any other newsweekly.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_s01_p02">The magazine has not been without its trials, however. In November of 2009 <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> published an article discussing Sarah Palin’s book, <em class="emphasis">Going Rogue: An American Life</em>. The cover of that issue featured a photo of Palin that had been used in an issue of <em class="emphasis">Runner’s World</em> with Palin in running attire. The words “How Do You Solve a Problem Like Sarah?” were splayed across the photograph.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_s01_p03">The cover caused a popular backlash, with readers calling it sexist and unfair. One reader suggested that <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> would never print a photograph of Barack Obama in such attire. In response, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> published a photo of President Obama in his swim trunks in its following issue, although this photo was smaller and on an inside page rather than on the cover.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_s02_p01"><em class="emphasis">Time</em> has remained an influential publication during the decades since its inception. Today, the publication prides itself on its “rare convergence of incisive reporting, lively writing and world-renowned photography,” which combined have earned it the praise of being “journalism at its best.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_040"><em class="emphasis">Time</em>, “National Editorial,” <a class="link" href="http://205.188.238.181/time/mediakit/1/us/timemagazine/national/">http://205.188.238.181/time/mediakit/1/us/timemagazine/national/</a>.</span> The magazine is divided into four main sections: Briefing, The Well, Life, and Arts. Briefing includes concise stories on major news events in the United States and other countries. The Well section features longer articles, including the cover story and articles on world and business. Life contains stories on health, science, technology, and the environment. Finally, Arts consists of reviews of theater, film, literature, music, exhibits, and architecture. Like <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, <em class="emphasis">Time</em> has won numerous awards and prides itself on being “the guide through chaos” in an era of information overload.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_041"><em class="emphasis">Time</em>, “National Editorial,” <a class="link" href="http://205.188.238.181/time/mediakit/1/us/timemagazine/national/">http://205.188.238.181/time/mediakit/1/us/timemagazine/national/</a>.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block"><em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em></h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_s03_p01">Created through the merger of a newspaper and a magazine, <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> has gained great prestige over the years. In 1933—the same year that <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> debuted—journalist David Lawrence began publishing a weekly newspaper called the <em class="emphasis">United States News</em>. Six years later, he founded a weekly magazine titled <em class="emphasis">World Report</em>. In 1948, the two weeklies merged to create the new <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em>. The magazine’s focus is similar to those of <em class="emphasis">Time</em> and <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, but <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> concentrates more on political, economic, health, and education stories, perhaps in part because it is based in Washington, DC. Although for most of its long history the magazine published weekly, in 2008 it announced its transition to a monthly printing schedule, vowing to concentrate on its website.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_s03_p02">The magazine is perhaps best known for its annual ranking of U.S. colleges. This ranking began in 1983 and has since evolved to include newsstand books of <em class="emphasis">America’s Best Colleges</em> and <em class="emphasis">America’s Best Graduate Schools</em>. Since the ranking system began, students turn to the publication for information about the strengths and weaknesses of institutions of higher learning.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Women’s Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p01">Female readers have been important to the magazine industry since the early 19th century, initially because women were not traditionally part of the workforce and were believed to have more leisure time to read. This lucrative market has only grown over time. In an increasingly online era, many magazines have sought ways to expand their scope to reach a larger audience. Yet others, such as <em class="emphasis">Ladies’ Home Journal</em>, <em class="emphasis">Good Housekeeping</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Better Homes and Gardens</em>, have maintained their original scope and have still managed to turn profits. These three periodicals are part of the “Seven Sisters,” a group of magazines traditionally targeted at women.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Ladies’ Home Journal</em> began in 1879 as a column for women published in the <em class="emphasis">Tribune and Farmer</em> newspaper.

Today, the publishers of the <em class="emphasis">Ladies’ Home Journal</em> state that it is “a unique lifestyle magazine dedicated to the millions of American women who want to look good, do good and feel great.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_043"><em class="emphasis">Ladies’ Home Journal</em>, “Mission Statement,” <a class="link" href="http://www.meredith.com/mediakit/lhj/print/index.htm">http://www.meredith.com/mediakit/lhj/print/index.htm</a>.</span> Ranked twelfth in circulation, the magazine presently has a readership of nearly 4 million.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_044">Echo Media, “Ladies’ Home Journal,” <a class="link" href="http://www.echo-media.com/mediaDetail.php?ID=4162">http://www.echo-media.com/mediaDetail.php?ID=4162</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">Ladies’ Home Journal</em> focuses on style, health, relationships, and food. Perhaps its most recognizable feature is a column titled “Can This Marriage Be Saved?,” which made its debut in 1953. The regular column features stories of real-life couples struggling in their marriages, offers advice from marriage and family therapists, and projects the outcomes.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p01">First published in 1886, the female-targeted <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> has changed dramatically over time from its original intent of being a “first-class family magazine.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_051">Frank Luthor Mott, <em class="emphasis">A History of American Magazines: 1885–1905</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1957), 480.</span> In the first issue, the editor told readers that “there will be a department devoted exclusively to the interests of women, with articles on fashions, on household decoration, on cooking, and the care and management of children, etc., also a department for the younger members of the family.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_052">Frank Luthor Mott, <em class="emphasis">A History of American Magazines: 1885–1905</em> (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1957), 480.</span> Just 2 years later, however, the original publishing company went out of business, and after several publisher changes <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> was eventually purchased by newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst in 1905.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p02">The magazine became more successful during the 1960s when Helen Gurley Brown “transformed an antiquated general-interest mag called <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> into the must-read for young, sexy single chicks.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_053">Jennifer Benjamin, “How Cosmo Changed the World,” <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world">http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world</a>.</span> Brown transformed the magazine from the family-focused publication it was to the somewhat controversial read with an emphasis on sex, work, and fashion that it is today. The magazine describes the transformation saying the following:</p>

                <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p03">Over the years, <em class="emphasis">Cosmo</em> has not only become the number-one-selling monthly magazine on the newsstand, but it has also served as an agent for social change, encouraging women everywhere to go after what they want (whether it be in the boardroom or the bedroom).<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_054">Jennifer Benjamin, “How Cosmo Changed the World,” <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world">http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p04">In 1965, <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> revamped its journal with Brown’s vision in mind. The first retooled issue had an article about birth-control pills, then a relatively new and controversial innovation. The magazine’s provocative articles attracted a large readership, but many found it offensive. Conservatives believed that the content was too racy, while some feminists thought it was too focused on beauty and pleasing men.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_055">Jennifer Benjamin, “How Cosmo Changed the World,” <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world">http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world</a>.</span> Yet the publishers of <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> believed that they were introducing a new form of feminism.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_056">Jennifer Benjamin, “How Cosmo Changed the World,” <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world">http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world</a>.</span> Brown argued that “<em class="emphasis">Cosmo</em> is feminist in that we believe women are just as smart and capable as men are and can achieve anything men can. But it also acknowledges that while work is important, men are too. The <em class="emphasis">Cosmo</em> girl absolutely loves men!”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_057">Jennifer Benjamin, “How Cosmo Changed the World,” <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world">http://www.cosmopolitan.com/about/about-us_how-cosmo-changed-the-world</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s04_p05">Today, <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> continues to attract readers by maintaining the same ideals that Brown put forth in the 1960s. Nearly 30 percent of every issue is dedicated to relationships, sex especially. The rest provides articles on beauty, fashion, entertainment, health and fitness, and self-improvement.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Men’s Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p01">Just as women’s magazines have existed for much of the history of the medium, over the years many magazines have been devoted to male readers. One of the most enduring and popular of those magazines is <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p01">When <em class="emphasis">Time</em> cocreator Henry Luce launched <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em> in 1954, his staff was doubtful about its chances. Spectator sports had not yet reached the level of popularity they have today, and the new magazine failed to make a profit for its first 12 years of publication. As television brought spectator sports to the growing suburbs, however, their popularity quickly rose, and <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em> became a success. Managing editor Andre Laguerre assembled a staff of talented, loyal writers and instituted the extensive use of color photographs, developing the basis for the format the magazine still uses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p02">In 1964, Laguerre initiated the <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em> Swimsuit Edition as a way of increasing sales during the winter months when there are fewer developments in sports. Putting model Babette March on the cover in a bikini helped the magazine sell, and the swimsuit edition became an annual tradition. Filled with pictures of models in revealing swimwear, the issue generates its share of controversy but is consistently the best-selling issue of the magazine each year.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s05_p01">Despite being criticized at times for their less-than-sophisticated approach to journalism, celebrity magazines bring in enormous profits and help shape U.S. pop culture, fueling the obsession some Americans have with the mundane day-to-day details of the lives of celebrities. Three of the most prominent celebrity magazines currently publishing are <em class="emphasis">People</em>, <em class="emphasis">OK!</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Us Weekly</em>.</p>

The publication sets itself apart from other celebrity gossip magazines by publishing human-interest stories alongside photos and articles about celebrities. The publishers of <em class="emphasis">People</em> state that they avoid pure Hollywood gossip articles and they refuse to publish stories without some sort of verification.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_058">Alyssa Moni, “An Inside Look at People Magazine,” March 31, 2011, <a class="link" href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/bu/inside-look-people-magazine">http://www.hercampus.com/school/bu/inside-look-people-magazine</a>.</span> This editorial slant is unique among celebrity magazines, and, as such, the publication frequently receives exclusive interviews and photo shoots with celebrities. The somewhat more respectful relationship between the publishers and some celebrities has helped <em class="emphasis">People</em> become the most popular celebrity magazine in circulation, ranking thirteenth overall with a verified readership of over 3.6 million in 2010.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_059">Alyssa Moni, “An Inside Look at People Magazine,” March 31, 2011, <a class="link" href="http://www.hercampus.com/school/bu/inside-look-people-magazine">http://www.hercampus.com/school/bu/inside-look-people-magazine</a>.</span></p>
