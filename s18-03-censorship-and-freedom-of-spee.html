    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_p01">To fully understand the issues of censorship and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">freedom of speech</a><span class="glossdef">A right granted to U.S. citizens in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, whereby individuals have the right to speak their minds without fear of prosecution.</span></span> and how they apply to modern media, we must first explore the terms themselves. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Censorship</a><span class="glossdef">The institution of suppressing or removing anything considered objectionable.</span></span> is defined as suppressing or removing anything deemed objectionable. A common, everyday example can be found on the radio or television, where potentially offensive words are “bleeped” out. More controversial is censorship at a political or religious level. If you’ve ever been banned from reading a book in school, or watched a “clean” version of a movie on an airplane, you’ve experienced censorship.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_p02">Much as media legislation can be controversial due to First Amendment protections, censorship in and of the media is often hotly debated. The First Amendment states that “Congress shall make no law…abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_050">“First Amendment—Religion and Expression,” <a class="link" href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/">http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment01/</a>.</span> Under this definition, the term “speech” extends to a broader sense of “expression,” meaning verbal, nonverbal, visual, or symbolic expression. Historically, many individuals have cited the First Amendment when protesting FCC decisions to censor certain media products or programs. However, what many people do not realize is that U.S. law establishes several exceptions to free speech, including defamation, hate speech, breach of the peace, incitement to crime, sedition, and obscenity.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Classifying Material as Indecent, Obscene, or Profane</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p01">To comply with U.S. law, the FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene programming. The FCC decides whether or not material is obscene by using a three-prong test.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p02">Obscene material has the following characteristics:
</p>
<ol class="orderedlist" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_o01" numeration="arabic">                <li>Causes the average person to have lustful or sexual thoughts</li>
                <li>Depicts lawfully offensive sexual conduct</li>
                <li>Lacks literary, artistic, political, or scientific value</li>
</ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p03">Material meeting all of these criteria is officially considered obscene and usually applies to hard-core pornography.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_051">Federal Communications Commission, “Obscenity, Indecency &amp; Profanity: Frequently Asked Questions,” <a class="link" href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html</a>.</span> “Indecent” material, on the other hand, is protected by the First Amendment and cannot be banned entirely.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p04">Indecent material has the following characteristics:
</p>
<ol class="orderedlist" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_o02" numeration="arabic">                <li>Contains graphic sexual or excretory depictions</li>

                <li>Is used simply to shock or arouse an audience</li>
</ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p05">Material deemed indecent cannot be broadcast between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., to make it less likely that children will be exposed to it.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_052">Federal Communications Commission, “Obscenity, Indecency &amp; Profanity: Frequently Asked Questions,” <a class="link" href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p06">These classifications symbolize the media’s long struggle with what is considered appropriate and inappropriate material. Despite the existence of the guidelines, however, the process of categorizing materials is a long and arduous one.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p07">There is a formalized process for deciding what material falls into which category. First, the FCC relies on television audiences to alert the agency of potentially controversial material that may require classification. The commission asks the public to file a complaint via letter, email, fax, telephone, or the agency’s website, including the station, the community, and the date and time of the broadcast. The complaint should “contain enough detail about the material broadcast that the FCC can understand the exact words and language used.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_053">Federal Communications Commission, “Obscenity, Indecency &amp; Profanity: Frequently Asked Questions,” <a class="link" href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html</a>.</span> Citizens are also allowed to submit tapes or transcripts of the aired material. Upon receiving a complaint, the FCC logs it in a database, which a staff member then accesses to perform an initial review. If necessary, the agency may contact either the station licensee or the individual who filed the complaint for further information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p08">Once the FCC has conducted a thorough investigation, it determines a final classification for the material. In the case of profane or indecent material, the agency may take further actions, including possibly fining the network or station.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_054">Federal Communications Commission, “Obscenity, Indecency &amp; Profanity: Frequently Asked Questions,” <a class="link" href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html</a>.</span> If the material is classified as obscene, the FCC will instead refer the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice, which has the authority to criminally prosecute the media outlet. If convicted in court, violators can be subject to criminal fines and/or imprisonment.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_055">Federal Communications Commission, “Obscenity, Indecency &amp; Profanity: Frequently Asked Questions,” <a class="link" href="http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html">http://www.fcc.gov/eb/oip/FAQ.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s01_p09">Each year, the FCC receives thousands of complaints regarding obscene, indecent, or profane programming. While the agency ultimately defines most programs cited in the complaints as appropriate, many complaints require in-depth investigation and may result in fines called notices of apparent liability (NAL) or federal investigation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_p01">Although popular memory thinks of old black-and-white movies as tame or sanitized, many early filmmakers filled their movies with sexual or violent content. Edwin S. Porter’s 1903 silent film <em class="emphasis">The Great Train Robbery</em>, for example, is known for expressing “the appealing, deeply embedded nature of violence in the frontier experience and the American civilizing process,” and showcases “the rather spontaneous way that the attendant violence appears in the earliest developments of cinema.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_056">“Violence,” Film Reference, <a class="link" href="http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Violence-BEGINNINGS.html">http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Violence-BEGINNINGS.html</a>.</span> The film ends with an image of a gunman firing a revolver directly at the camera, demonstrating that cinema’s fascination with violence was present even 100 years ago.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_p02">Porter was not the only U.S. filmmaker working during the early years of cinema to employ graphic violence. Films such as <em class="emphasis">Intolerance</em> (1916) and <em class="emphasis">The Birth of a Nation</em> (1915) are notorious for their overt portrayals of violent activities. The director of both films, D. W. Griffith, intentionally portrayed content graphically because he “believed that the portrayal of violence must be uncompromised to show its consequences for humanity.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_057">“Violence,” Film Reference, <a class="link" href="http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Violence-BEGINNINGS.html">http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Violence-BEGINNINGS.html</a>.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s01_p01">Although audiences responded eagerly to the new medium of film, some naysayers believed that Hollywood films and their associated hedonistic culture was a negative moral influence. As you read in <a class="xref" href="lulemedia_1.0-ch08#lulemedia_1.0-ch08">Chapter 8 "Movies"</a>, this changed during the 1930s with the implementation of the Hays Code. Formally termed the Motion Picture Production Code of 1930, the code is popularly known by the name of its author, Will Hays, the chairman of the industry’s self-regulatory Motion Picture Producers and Distributors Association (MPPDA), which was founded in 1922 to “police all in-house productions.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_058">“Violence,” Film Reference, <a class="link" href="http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Violence-BEGINNINGS.html">http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Romantic-Comedy-Yugoslavia/Violence-BEGINNINGS.html</a>.</span> Created to forestall what was perceived to be looming governmental control over the industry, the Hays Code was, essentially, Hollywood self-censorship. The code displayed the motion picture industry’s commitment to the public, stating the following:</p>

Hence, though regarding motion pictures primarily as entertainment without any explicit purposes of teaching or propaganda, they know that the motion picture within its own field of entertainment may be directly responsible for spiritual or moral progress, for higher types of social life, and for much correct thinking.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn15_059">“The Motion Picture Production Code of 1930 (Hays Code),” ArtsReformation, <a class="link" href="http://www.artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html">http://www.artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html</a>.</span></p>

Propelled by the changing moral standards of the 1950s and 1960s, this led to a gradual reintroduction of violence and sex into mass media.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s02_p01">As filmmakers began pushing the boundaries of acceptable visual content, the Hollywood studio industry scrambled to create a system to ensure appropriate audiences for films. In 1968, the successor of the MPDDA, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA), established the familiar film ratings system to help alert potential audiences to the type of content they could expect from a production.</p>
            <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s02_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
                <h2 class="title editable block">Film Ratings</h2>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s02_s01_p01">Although the ratings system changed slightly in its early years, by 1972 it seemed that the MPAA had settled on its ratings. These ratings consisted of G (general audiences), PG (parental guidance suggested), R (restricted to age 17 or up unless accompanied by a parent), and X (completely restricted to age 17 and up). The system worked until 1984, when several major battles took place over controversial material. During that year, the highly popular films <em class="emphasis">Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</em> and <em class="emphasis">Gremlins</em> both premiered with a PG rating. Both films—and subsequently the MPAA—received criticism for the explicit violence presented on screen, which many viewers considered too intense for the relatively mild PG rating. In response to the complaints, the MPAA introduced the PG-13 rating to indicate that some material may be inappropriate for children under the age of 13. Examples of films with a PG-13 rating include <em class="emphasis">Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2</em> (2011), <em class="emphasis">Avatar</em> (2009), <em class="emphasis">The Dark Knight</em> (2008), and <em class="emphasis">Titanic</em> (1999).</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s02_s01_p02">Another change came to the ratings system in 1990, with the introduction of the NC-17 rating. Carrying the same restrictions as the existing X rating, the new designation came at the behest of the film industry to distinguish mature films from pornographic ones. Examples of films with an NC-17 rating include <em class="emphasis">Showgirls</em> (1995) and <em class="emphasis">Crash</em> (1996). Despite the arguably milder format of the rating’s name, many filmmakers find it too strict in practice; receiving an NC-17 rating often leads to a lack of promotion or distribution because numerous movie theaters and rental outlets refuse to carry films with this rating.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch15_s03_s02_s02_s02_p01">Regardless of these criticisms, most audience members find the rating system helpful, particularly when determining what is appropriate for children. The adoption of industry ratings for television programs and video games reflects the success of the film ratings system. During the 1990s, for example, the broadcasting industry introduced a voluntary rating system not unlike that used for films to accompany all television shows. These ratings are displayed on screen during the first 15 seconds of a program and include TV-Y (all children), TV-Y7 (children age 7 and above), TV-Y7-FV (older children—fantasy violence), TV-G (general audience), TV-PG (parental guidance suggested), TV-14 (parents strongly cautioned), and TV-MA (mature audiences only).</p>
