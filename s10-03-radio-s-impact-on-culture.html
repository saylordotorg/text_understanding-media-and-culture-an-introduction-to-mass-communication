    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_p01">Since its inception, radio’s impact on American culture has been immense. Modern popular culture is unthinkable without the early influence of radio. Entire genres of music that are now taken for granted, such as country and rock, owe their popularity and even existence to early radio programs that publicized new forms.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">A New Kind of Mass Media</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p01">Mass media such as newspapers had been around for years before the existence of radio. In fact, radio was intially considered a kind of disembodied newspaper. Although this idea gave early proponents a useful, familiar way to think about radio, it underestimated radio’s power as a medium. Newspapers had the potential to reach a wide audience, but radio had the potential to reach almost everyone. Neither illiteracy nor even a busy schedule impeded radio’s success—one could now perform an activity and listen to the radio at the same time. This unprecedented reach made radio an instrument of social cohesion as it brought together members of different classes and backgrounds to experience the world as a nation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p02">Radio programs reflected this nationwide cultural aspect of radio. <em class="emphasis">Vox Pop</em>, a show originally based on person-in-the-street interviews, was an early attempt to quantify the United States’ growing mass culture. Beginning in 1935, the program billed itself as an unrehearsed “cross-section of what the average person really knows” by asking random people an assortment of questions. Many modern television shows still employ this format not only for viewers’ amusement and information but also as an attempt to sum up national culture.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_077">Jason Loviglio, “Vox Pop: Network Radio and the Voice of the People” in <em class="emphasis">Radio Reader: Essays in the Cultural History of Radio</em>, ed. Michele Hilmes and Jason Loviglio (New York: Routledge, 2002), 89–106.</span> <em class="emphasis">Vox Pop</em> functioned on a cultural level as an acknowledgement of radio’s entrance into people’s private lives to make them public.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_078">Jason Loviglio, “Vox Pop: Network Radio and the Voice of the People” in <em class="emphasis">Radio Reader: Essays in the Cultural History of Radio</em>, ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p03">Radio news was more than just a quick way to find out about events; it was a way for U.S. citizens to experience events with the same emotions. During the Ohio and Mississippi river floods of 1937, radio brought the voices of those who suffered as well as the voices of those who fought the rising tides. A West Virginia newspaper explained the strengths of radio in providing emotional voices during such crises: “Thanks to radio … the nation as a whole has had its nerves, its heart, its soul exposed to the needs of its unfortunates … We are a nation integrated and interdependent. We are ‘our brother’s keeper.’”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_079">Robert Brown, <em class="emphasis">Manipulating the Ether: The Power of Broadcast Radio in Thirties America</em> (Jefferson, NC: MacFarland, 1998), 140.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p04">Radio’s presence in the home also heralded the evolution of consumer culture in the United States. In 1941, two-thirds of radio programs carried advertising. Radio allowed advertisers to sell products to a captive audience. This kind of mass marketing ushered in a new age of consumer culture.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_080">Sean Cashman, <em class="emphasis">America in the Twenties and Thirties: The Olympian Age of Franklin Delano Roosevelt</em> (New York: New York University Press, 1989), 329.</span></p>

            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p05">During the 1930s, radio’s impact and powerful social influence was perhaps most obvious in the aftermath of the Orson Welles’s notorious <em class="emphasis">War of the Worlds</em> broadcast. On Halloween night in 1938, radio producer Orson Welles told listeners of the <em class="emphasis">Mercury Theatre on the Air</em> that they would be treated to an original adaptation of H. G. Wells’s classic science fiction novel of alien invasion <em class="emphasis">War of the Worlds</em>. The adaptation started as if it were a normal music show that was interrupted by news reports of an alien invasion. Many listeners had tuned in late and did not hear the disclaimer, and so were caught up by the realism of the adaptation, believing it to be an actual news story.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Radio and the Development of Popular Music</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_p01">One of radio’s most enduring legacies is its impact on music. Before radio, most popular songs were distributed through piano sheet music and word of mouth. This necessarily limited the types of music that could gain national prominence. Although recording technology had also emerged several decades before radio, music played live over the radio sounded better than it did on a record played in the home. Live music performances thus became a staple of early radio. Many performance venues had their own radio transmitters to broadcast live shows—for example, Harlem’s Cotton Club broadcast performances that CBS picked up and broadcast nationwide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_p02">Radio networks mainly played swing jazz, giving the bands and their leaders a widespread audience. Popular bandleaders including Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Tommy Dorsey and their jazz bands became nationally famous through their radio performances, and a host of other jazz musicians flourished as radio made the genre nationally popular.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_086">Elijah Wald, <em class="emphasis">How the Beatles Destroyed Rock ’n’ Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 100–104.</span> National networks also played classical music. Often presented in an educational context, this programming had a different tenor than did dance-band programming. NBC promoted the genre through shows such as the <em class="emphasis">Music Appreciation Hour</em>, which sought to educate both young people and the general public on the nuances of classical music.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_087">Sondra Wieland Howe, “The NBC Music Appreciation Hour: Radio Broadcasts of Walter Damrosch, 1928–1942,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Research in Music Education</em> 51, no. 1 (Spring 2003).</span> It created the NBC Symphony Orchestra, a 92-piece band under the direction of famed conductor Arturo Toscanini. The orchestra made its first performance in 1937 and was so popular that Toscanini stayed on as conductor for 17 years.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_088">Joseph Horowitz, <em class="emphasis">Classical Music in America: A History of Its Rise and Fall</em> (New York: Norton, 2005), 399–404.</span> The Metropolitan Opera was also popular; its broadcasts in the early 1930s had an audience of 9 million listeners.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_089">Joseph Horowitz, <em class="emphasis">Classical Music in America: A History of Its Rise and Fall</em> (New York: Norton, 2005), 364.</span></p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p01">The promotional power of radio also gave regional music an immense boost. Local stations often carried their own programs featuring the popular music of the area. Stations such as Nashville, Tennessee’s WSM played early country, blues, and folk artists. The history of this station illustrates the ways in which radio—and its wide range of broadcasting—created new perspectives on American culture. In 1927, WSM’s program <em class="emphasis">Barn Dance</em>, which featured early country music and blues, followed an hour-long program of classical music. George Hay, the host of <em class="emphasis">Barn Dance</em>, used the juxtaposition of classical and country genres to spontaneously rename the show: “For the past hour we have been listening to music taken largely from Grand Opera, but from now on we will present ‘The Grand Ole Opry.’”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_090">Louis Kyriakoudes, <em class="emphasis">The Social Origins of the Urban South</em>: <em class="emphasis">Race, Gender, and Migration in Nashville and Middle Tennessee, 1890–1930</em> (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 7.</span> NBC picked up the program for national syndication in 1939, and it is currently one of the longest-running radio program of all time.</p>

This program propelled stars such as Hank Williams into the national spotlight. Country music, formerly a mix of folk, blues, and mountain music, was made into a genre that was accessible by the nation through this show. Without programs that featured these country and blues artists, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash would not have become national stars, and country music may not have risen to become a popular genre.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_091">Nate DiMeo, “New York Clashes with the Heartland,” Hearing America: A Century of Music on the Radio, <em class="emphasis">American Public Media</em>, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/radio/b1.html">http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/radio/b1.html</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s01_p03">In the 1940s, other Southern stations also began playing rhythm and blues records recorded by black artists. Artists such as Wynonie Harris, famous for his rendition of Roy Brown’s “Good Rockin’ Tonight,” were often played by white disc jockeys who tried to imitate black Southerners.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_092">Tracey Laird, <em class="emphasis">Louisiana Hayride: Radio and Roots Music Along the Red River</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 4–10.</span> During the late 1940s, both Memphis, Tennessee’s WDIA and Atlanta, Georgia’s WERD were owned and operated by black individuals.

            <h2 class="title editable block">Radio’s Lasting Influences</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s02_p01">Radio technology changed the way that dance and popular music was performed. Because of the use of microphones, vocalists could be heard better over the band, allowing singers to use a greater vocal range and create more expressive styles, an innovation that led singers to become an important part of popular music’s image. The use of microphones similarly allowed individual performers to be featured playing solos and lead parts, features that were less encouraged before radio. The exposure of radio also led to more rapid turnover in popular music. Before radio, jazz bands played the same arrangement for several years without it getting old, but as radio broadcasts reached wide audiences, new arrangements and songs had to be produced at a more rapid pace to keep up with changing tastes.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_094">Elijah Wald, <em class="emphasis">How the Beatles Destroyed Rock ’n’ Roll: An Alternative History of American Popular Music</em> (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), 95–96.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s02_p02">The spotlight of radio allowed the personalities of artists to come to the forefront of popular music, giving them newfound notoriety. Phil Harris, the bandleader from the <em class="emphasis">Jack Benny Show</em>, became the star of his own program. Other famous musicians used radio talent shows to gain fame. Popular programs such as <em class="emphasis">Major Bowes and His Original Amateur Hour</em> featured unknown entertainers trying to gain fame through exposure to the show’s large audience. Major Bowes used a gong to usher bad performers offstage, often contemptuously dismissing them, but not all the performers struck out; such successful singers as Frank Sinatra debuted on the program.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_095">Christopher Sterling and John Kittross, <em class="emphasis">Stay Tuned: A History of American Broadcasting</em>, 3rd ed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s02_s02_p03">Television, much like modern popular music, owes a significant debt to the Golden Age of Radio. Major radio networks such as NBC, ABC, and CBS became—and remain—major forces in television, and their programming decisions for radio formed the basis for television. Actors, writers, and directors who worked in radio simply transferred their talents into the world of early television, using the successes of radio as their models.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Radio and Politics</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_p01">Over the years, radio has had a considerable influence on the political landscape of the United States. In the past, government leaders relied on radio to convey messages to the public, such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s “fireside chats.” Radio was also used as a way to generate propaganda for World War II. The War Department established a Radio Division in its Bureau of Public Relations as early as 1941. Programs such as the <em class="emphasis">Treasury Hour</em> used radio drama to raise revenue through the sale of war bonds, but other government efforts took a decidedly political turn. Norman Corwin’s <em class="emphasis">This Is War!</em> was funded by the federal Office of Facts and Figures (OFF) to directly garner support for the war effort. It featured programs that prepared listeners to make personal sacrifices—including death—to win the war. The program was also directly political, popularizing the idea that the New Deal was a success and bolstering Roosevelt’s image through comparisons with Lincoln.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_096">Gerd Horten, <em class="emphasis">Radio Goes to War: The Cultural Politics of Propaganda During World War II</em> (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 2002), 45–47.</span></p>

Roosevelt’s Depression-era radio talks, or “fireside chats,” remain one of the most famous uses of radio in politics. While governor of New York, Roosevelt had used radio as a political tool, so he quickly adopted it to explain the unprecedented actions that his administration was taking to deal with the economic fallout of the Great Depression. His first speech took place only 1 week after being inaugurated. Roosevelt had closed all of the banks in the country for 4 days while the government dealt with a national banking crisis, and he used the radio to explain his actions directly to the American people. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_097">John Grafton, ed., <em class="emphasis">Great Speeches—Franklin Delano Roosevelt</em> (Mineola, NY: Dover, 1999), 34.</span></p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_p03">Roosevelt’s first radio address set a distinct tone as he employed informal speech in the hopes of inspiring confidence in the American people and of helping them stave off the kind of panic that could have destroyed the entire banking system.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_s01_p01">An important contemporary convergence of radio and politics can be readily heard on modern talk radio programs. Far from being simply chat shows, the talk radio that became popular in the 1980s features a host who takes callers and discusses a wide assortment of topics. Talk radio hosts gain and keep their listeners by sheer force of personality, and some say shocking or insulting things to get their message across. These hosts range from conservative radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh to so-called shock jocks such as Howard Stern.</p>

Despite its noble intentions of safeguarding public airwaves for diverse views, the doctrine had long attracted a level of dissent. Opponents of the Fairness Doctrine claimed that it had a chilling effect on political discourse as stations, rather than risk government intervention, avoided programs that were divisive or controversial.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_105">Gilbert Cruz, “GOP Rallies Behind Talk Radio,” <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, June 28, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1638662,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1638662,00.html</a>.</span> In 1987, the FCC under the Reagan administration repealed the regulation, setting the stage for an AM talk radio boom; by 2004, the number of talk radio stations had increased by 17-fold. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_106">Brian Anderson, <em class="emphasis">South Park Conservatives: The Revolt against Liberal Media Bias</em> (Washington D.C.: Regnery Publishing, 2005), 35–36.</span></p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s03_s01_s01_p02">The end of the Fairness Doctrine allowed stations to broadcast programs without worrying about finding an opposing point of view to balance the stated opinions of its host. Radio hosts representing all points of the political spectrum could say anything that they wanted to—within FCC limits—without fear of rebuttal. Media bias and its ramifications will be explored at greater length in <a class="xref" href="lulemedia_1.0-ch14#lulemedia_1.0-ch14">Chapter 14 "Ethics of Mass Media"</a>.</p>

With the Fairness Doctrine no longer a hindrance, these programs slowly gained notoriety during the late 1980 and early 1990s. In 1998, talk radio hosts railed against a proposed congressional pay increase, and their listeners became incensed; House Speaker Jim Wright received a deluge of faxes protesting it from irate talk radio listeners from stations all over the country.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_107">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 287.</span> Ultimately, Congress canceled the pay increase, and various print outlets acknowledged the influence of talk radio on the decision. Propelled by events such as these, talk radio stations rose from only 200 in the early 1980s to more than 850 in 1994.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_108">Susan Douglas, <em class="emphasis">Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination</em> (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2004), 286–287.</span></p>

In 1992, nine talk show hosts ran for U.S. Congress. By the middle of the decade, it had become common for many former—or failed—politicians to attempt to use the format. Former California governor Jerry Brown and former New York mayor Ed Koch were among the mid-1990s politicians that had AM talk shows.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_112">Annenberg Public Policy Center, <em class="emphasis">Call-In Political Talk Radio: Background, Content, Audiences, Portrayal in Mainstream Media</em>, Annenberg Public Policy Center Report Series, August 7, 1996, <a class="link" href="http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/Downloads/Political_Communication/Political_Talk_Radio/1996_03_political_talk_radio_rpt.PDF">http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/Downloads/Political_Communication/Political_Talk_Radio/1996_03_political_talk_radio_rpt.PDF</a>.</span> Both conservatives and liberals widely agree that conservative hosts dominate AM talk radio.

Hosts such as Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, and Bill O’Reilly furthered the trend of popular conservative talk shows, but liberal hosts also became popular through the short-lived Air America network. The network closed abruptly in 2010 amid financial concerns.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_113">Brian Stelter, “Liberal Radio, Even Without Air America,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 24, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/arts/25radio.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/25/arts/25radio.html</a>.</span> Although the network was unsuccessful, it provided a platform for such hosts as MSNBC TV news host Rachel Maddow and Minnesota Senator Al Franken.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Freedom of Speech and Radio Controversies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s04_p01">While the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution gives radio personalities the freedom to say nearly anything they want on the air without fear of prosecution (except in cases of obscenity, slander, or incitement of violence, which will be discussed in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="lulemedia_1.0-ch15#lulemedia_1.0-ch15">Chapter 15 "Media and Government"</a>), it does not protect them from being fired from their jobs when their controversial comments create a public outrage. Many talk radio hosts, such as Howard Stern, push the boundaries of acceptable speech to engage listeners and boost ratings, but sometimes radio hosts push too far, unleashing a storm of controversy.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s04_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Making (and Unmaking) a Career out of Controversy</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s04_s01_p01">Talk radio host Howard Stern has managed to build his career on creating controversy—despite being fined multiple times for indecency by the FCC, Stern remains one of highest-paid and most popular talk radio hosts in the United States. Stern’s radio broadcasts often feature scatalogical or sexual humor, creating an “anything goes” atmosphere. Because his on-air antics frequently generate controversy that can jeopardize advertising sponsorships and drive away offended listeners—in addition to risking fines from the FCC—Stern has a history of uneasy relationships with the radio stations that employ him. In an effort to free himself of conflicts with station owners and sponsors, in 2005 Stern signed a contract with Sirius Satellite Radio, which is exempt from FCC regulation, so that he can continue to broadcast his show without fear of censorship.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s04_s01_p02">Stern’s massive popularity gives him a lot of clout, which has allowed him to weather controversy and continue to have a successful career. Other radio hosts who have gotten themselves in trouble with poorly considered on-air comments have not been so lucky. In April 2007, Don Imus, host of the long-running <em class="emphasis">Imus in the Morning</em>, was suspended for racist and sexist comments made about the Rutgers University women’s basketball team.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_117"><em class="emphasis">Imus in the Morning</em>, MSNBC, April 4, 2007.</span> Though he publically apologized, the scandal continued to draw negative attention in the media, and CBS canceled his show to avoid further unfavorable publicity and the withdrawal of advertisers. Though he returned to the airwaves in December of that year with a different station, the episode was a major setback for Imus’s career and his public image. Similarly, syndicated conservative talk show host Dr. Laura Schelssinger ended her radio show in 2010 due to pressure from radio stations and sponsors after her repeated use of a racial epithet on a broadcast incited a public backlash.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn07_118"><em class="emphasis">Imus in the Morning</em>, MSNBC, April 4, 2007.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch07_s03_s04_s01_p03">As the examples of these talk radio hosts show, the issue of freedom of speech on the airwaves is often complicated by the need for radio stations to be profitable. Outspoken or shocking radio hosts can draw in many listeners, attracting advertisers to sponsor their shows and bringing in money for their radio stations. Although some listeners may be offended by these hosts and may stop tuning in, as long as the hosts continue to attract advertising dollars, their employers are usually content to allow the hosts to speak freely on the air. However, if a host’s behavior ends up sparking a major controversy, causing advertisers to withdraw their sponsorship to avoid tarnishing their brands, the radio station will often fire the host and look to someone who can better sustain advertising partnerships. Radio hosts’ right to free speech does not compel their employer to give them the forum to exercise it. Popular hosts like Don Imus may find a home on the air again once the furor has died down, but for radio hosts concerned about the stability of their careers, the lesson is clear: there are practical limits on their freedom of speech.</p>

                    <li>Radio was unique as a form of mass media because it had the potential to reach anyone, even the illiterate. Radio news in the 1930s and 1940s brought the emotional impact of traumatic events home to the listening public in a way that gave the nation a sense of unity.</li>
                    <li>Radio encouraged the growth of national popular music stars and brought regional sounds to wider audiences. The effects of early radio programs can be felt both in modern popular music and in television programming.</li>
                    <li>The Fairness Doctrine was created to ensure fair coverage of issues over the airwaves. It stated that radio stations must give equal time to contrasting points of view on an issue. An enormous rise in the popularity of AM talk radio occurred after the repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987.</li>
                    <li>The need for radio stations to generate revenue places practical limits on what radio personalities can say on the air. Shock jocks like Howard Stern and Don Imus test, and sometimes exceed, these limits and become controversial figures, highlighting the tension between freedom of speech and the need for businesses to be profitable.</li>
