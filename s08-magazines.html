        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s00_p01">On October 5, 2009, publisher Condé Nast announced that the November 2009 issue of respected food magazine <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> would be its last. The decision came as a shock to many readers who, since 1941, had believed that “<em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> was to food what <em class="emphasis">Vogue</em> is to fashion, a magazine with a rich history and a perch high in the publishing firmament.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_001">Stephanie Clifford, “Condé Nast Closes <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> and 3 Other Magazines,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 6, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/business/media/06gourmet.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/business/media/06gourmet.html</a>.</span> Although Condé Nast folded three other publications—parenting magazine <em class="emphasis">Cookie</em> and bridal magazines <em class="emphasis">Elegant Bride</em> and <em class="emphasis">Modern Bride</em>—the elimination of <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> received the most attention because of the publication’s long history and popularity. Although some readers were angry about the sudden print halt, some understood that the closure was simply a reflection of a changing market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s00_p02">Magazine publishers have been struggling with competition for advertising dollars for years. The magazine industry took a dramatic hit from the financial crisis that began in the fall of 2007, with many publications folding altogether, several moving to online-only models, and nearly all implementing mass layoffs to cut costs.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_002">Vocus Research, <em class="emphasis">State of the Media Report 2011: Adapting, Surviving, and Reviving</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.vocus.com/resources/state-of-media/2011-report-adapting-surviving-reviving.pdf">http://www.vocus.com/resources/state-of-media/2011-report-adapting-surviving-reviving.pdf</a>.</span> The crisis forced the high-end retailers that support Condé Nast magazines to slash their advertising budgets, and the subsequent decline in advertising revenue put the Condé Nast publications in jeopardy.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_003">Daniel Gross, “Don’t Make Me Eat My Words,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, October 7, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html">http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s00_p03">Although this appears to be grim news for an industry that has survived since the 17th century, magazines may not be truly obsolete. Many analysts are hopeful that the magazine industry, with its long, complex past, is simply in a slump. According to the Magazine Publishers of America, some 7,383 magazines appeared in publication in 2008.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_004">Association of Magazine Media, “Clearing up Misperceptions about Magazine Closings,” white paper, August 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.magazine.org/ASSETS/ACC5AFCF184843B9B8A4CE13080DB232/misperceptions-about-magazine-closings-082009.pdf">http://www.magazine.org/ASSETS/ACC5AFCF184843B9B8A4CE13080DB232/misperceptions-about-magazine-closings-082009.pdf</a>.</span> The following year, media private-equity firm Veronis Suhler Stevenson predicted that magazine ad revenues would stabilize in 2013.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_005">Stephanie Clifford, “A Look Ahead at the Money in the Communications Industry,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, August 3, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/business/media/04adco.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/04/business/media/04adco.html</a>.</span> Former <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> financial writer Daniel Gross—though admittedly biased—believes that the industry will strengthen. He describes the panic of some who refer to the demise of print media as symptoms of an “irrational depression surrounding print.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_006">Daniel Gross, “Don’t Make Me Eat My Words,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, October 7, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html">http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html</a>.</span> Yet even he admits that he may be mistaken in his belief that the current downward trend is just a bump in the road. As Gross stated, “[i]f I’m wrong, I may have to eat my words. And I’ll be doubly sad because I won’t have <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> to tell me what wine goes best with them.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_007">Daniel Gross, “Don’t Make Me Eat My Words,” <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, October 7, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html">http://www.newsweek.com/2009/10/06/don-t-make-me-eat-my-words.html</a>.</span> So, many have begun to wonder, what will the future of the magazine business hold?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s00_p04">If <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em>’s closure is any indication, the magazines of the future will be a product of cross-media integration, particularly between print and television. “Advertising support for luxurious magazines like <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> has dwindled, while grocery store advertisers have continued to buy pages at more accessible, celebrity-driven magazines like <em class="emphasis">Every Day with Rachel Ray</em>, which specializes in 30-minute meals, and <em class="emphasis">Food Network Magazine</em>.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_008">Stephanie Clifford, “Condé Nast Closes <em class="emphasis">Gourmet</em> and 3 Other Magazines,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 6, 2009, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/business/media/06gourmet.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/06/business/media/06gourmet.html</a>.</span> This trend suggests that the best—and perhaps only—way for magazines to remain viable is to gain an audience via another medium and then use that celebrity-driven status to sell the print product.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s00_p05">The magazine industry may change drastically over the next several years. This evolution may be affected by a number of variables, such as the Internet, a new generation of readers, the fluctuation of advertising costs, and the recovery from the 2008 recession. What remains to be seen is whether the magazine industry can continue to be a dominant force in American culture in the midst of these changes.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Early Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_p01">After the printing press became prevalent in Europe, early publishers began to conceptualize the magazine. Forerunners of the familiar modern magazine first appeared during the 17th century in the form of brochures, pamphlets, and almanacs. Soon, publishers realized that irregular publication schedules required too much time and energy. A gradual shift then occurred as publishers sought regular readers with specific interests. But the early magazine was unlike any other previous publication. It was not enough of a news source to be a newspaper, but it could not be considered pleasure reading either. Instead, early magazines occupied the middle ground between the two. <span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_009"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span></p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Germany, France, and the Netherlands Lead the Way</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p01">German theologian and poet Johann Rist published the first true magazine between 1663 and 1668. Titled <em class="emphasis">Erbauliche Monaths-Unterredungen</em>, or <em class="emphasis">Edifying Monthly Discussions</em>, Rist’s publication inspired a number of others to begin printing literary journals across Europe: Denis de Sallo’s French <em class="emphasis">Journal des Sçavans</em> (1665), the Royal Society’s English <em class="emphasis">Philosophical Transactions</em> (1665), and Francesco Nazzari’s Italian <em class="emphasis">Giomale de’letterati</em> (1668). In 1684, exiled Frenchman Pierre Bayle published <em class="emphasis">Novelles de la République des Lettres</em> in the Netherlands to escape French censorship. Profoundly affected by a general revival of learning during the 1600s, the publications inspired enthusiasm for education.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p02">Another Frenchman, Jean Donneau de Vizé, published the first “periodical of amusement,” <em class="emphasis">Le Mercure Galant</em> (later renamed <em class="emphasis">Mercure de France</em>), in 1672, which contained news, short stories, and poetry. This combination of news and pleasurable reading became incredibly popular, causing other publications to imitate the magazine.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_010"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> This lighter magazine catered to a different reader than did the other, more intellectual publications of the day, offering articles for entertainment and enjoyment rather than for education.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s01_s01_p03">With the arrival of the 18th century came an increase in literacy. Women, who enjoyed a considerable rise in literacy rates, began reading in record numbers. This growth affected the literary world as a whole, inspiring a large number of female writers to publish novels for female readers.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_011">Abby Wolf, “Introduction,” 19th Century Women Writers, PBS, <a class="link" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wives/writers/intro.html">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/wives/writers/intro.html</a>.</span> This influx of female readers also helped magazines flourish as more women sought out the publications as a source of knowledge and entertainment. In fact, many magazines jumped at the chance to reach out to women. The <em class="emphasis">Athenian Mercury</em>, the first magazine written specifically for women, appeared in 1693.</p>

During the early 18th century, three major influential magazines published regularly in Great Britain: <em class="emphasis">Robinson Crusoe</em> author Daniel Defoe’s the <em class="emphasis">Review</em>, Sir Richard Steele’s the <em class="emphasis">Tatler</em>, and Joseph Addison and Steele’s the <em class="emphasis">Spectator</em>.</p>

The <em class="emphasis">Review</em> focused primarily on domestic and foreign affairs and featured opinion-based political articles. The <em class="emphasis">Spectator</em> replaced the <em class="emphasis">Tatler</em>, which published from 1709 to 1711.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_p01">The first American magazines debuted in 1741, when Andrew Bradford’s <em class="emphasis">American Magazine</em> and Benjamin Franklin’s <em class="emphasis">General Magazine</em> began publication in Philadelphia a mere 3 days apart from each other. Neither magazine lasted long, however; <em class="emphasis">American Magazine</em> folded after only 3 months and <em class="emphasis">General Magazine</em> after 6. The short-lived nature of the publications likely had less to do with the outlets themselves and more to do with the fact that they were “limited by too few readers with leisure time to read, high costs of publishing, and expensive distribution systems.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_013">Joseph Straubhaar, Robert Larose, and Lucinda Davenport, <em class="emphasis">Media Now: Understanding Media, Culture, and Technology</em> (Boston: Wadsworth, 2009).</span> Regardless of this early setback, magazines began to flourish during the latter half of the 18th century, and by the end of the 1700s, more than 100 magazines had appeared in the nascent United States. Despite this large publication figure, typical colonial magazines still recorded low <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">circulation</a><span class="glossdef">The number of copies of a magazine distributed.</span></span> figures and were considered highbrow.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s02_s01_p01">All this changed during the 1830s when publishers began taking advantage of a general decline in the cost of printing and mailing publications and started producing less-expensive magazines with a wider audience in mind. Magazine style also transformed. While early magazines focused on improvement and reason, later versions focused on amusement. No longer were magazines focused on the elite class. Publishers took advantage of their freshly expanded audience and began offering family magazines, children’s magazines, and women’s magazines. Women’s publications again proved to be a highly lucrative market. One of the earliest American women’s magazines was <em class="emphasis">Godey’s Lady’s Book</em>, a Philadelphia-based monthly that printed between 1830 and 1898. This particular magazine reached out to female readers by employing nearly 150 women.</p>

Based in Boston, Massachusetts, this periodical featured fairly religious content and developed a reputation as a wholesome magazine that encouraged young readers to be virtuous and pious.

Most publications cost the then-hefty sum of 25 or 35 cents per issue, limiting readership to the relative few who could afford them. This all changed in 1893 when Samuel Sidney McClure began selling <em class="emphasis">McClure’s Magazine</em>, originally a literary and political magazine, at the bargain price of only 15 cents per issue. The trend caught on. Soon, <em class="emphasis">Cosmopolitan</em> (founded 1886) began selling for 12.5 cents, while <em class="emphasis">Munsey Magazine</em> (1886–1929) sold for only 10 cents.

In the early days of the industry, many publications attempted to keep advertisements out of their issues because of publishers’ natural fondness toward literature and writing.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_019"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> However, once circulation increased, advertisers sought out space in magazines to reach the larger audience. Magazines responded by raising advertising rates, ultimately increasing their profitability. By the turn of the 20th century, advertising became the norm in magazines, particularly in some women’s magazine, where advertisements accounted for nearly half of all content.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_p01">The arrival of the 20th century brought with it new types of magazines, including news, business, and picture magazines. In time, these types of publications came to dominate the industry and attract vast readerships.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p01">As publishers became interested in succinctly presenting the fresh increase of worldwide information that technology made available during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they designed the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">newsmagazine</a><span class="glossdef">A journal that specializes in reporting and commenting on current events.</span></span>. In 1923, <em class="emphasis">Time</em> became the first newsmagazine that focused on world news. <em class="emphasis">Time</em> first began publication with the proposition that “people are uninformed because no publication has adapted itself to the time which busy men are able to spend simply keeping informed.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_020"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> Although the periodical struggled during its early years, <em class="emphasis">Time</em> hit its stride in 1928 and its readership grew. The magazine’s signature style of well-researched news presented in a succinct manner contributed greatly to its eventual success.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s01_p02">Several other newsmagazines came onto the market during this era as well. <em class="emphasis">Business Week</em> was founded in 1929 with a focus on the global market. <em class="emphasis">Forbes</em>, currently one of the most popular financial magazines, began printing in 1917 as a biweekly publication. In 1933, a former <em class="emphasis">Time</em> foreign editor founded <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, which now has a circulation of nearly 4 million readers. Today, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> and <em class="emphasis">Time</em> continue to compete with each other, furthering a trend that began in the early years of <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>.</p>

The most influential picture magazine was Henry Luce’s <em class="emphasis">Life</em>, which regularly published between 1936 and 1972. Within weeks of its initial publication, <em class="emphasis">Life</em> had a circulation of 1 million. In Luce’s words, the publication aimed “to see life; to see the world; to witness great events; to watch the faces of the poor and the gestures of the proud; to see strange things.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_021"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> It did not disappoint. Widely credited with establishing photojournalism, <em class="emphasis">Life</em> captured the attention of many on first read. With 96 large-format glossy pages, even the inaugural issue sold out. The opening photograph depicted an obstetrician holding a newborn baby with the caption “Life begins”.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s01_s03_s02_p02">While <em class="emphasis">Life</em> was the most influential picture magazine, it was certainly not the only photo-centric publication. Popular biweekly picture magazine <em class="emphasis">Look</em> printed between 1937 and 1971, claiming to compete with <em class="emphasis">Life</em> by reaching out to a larger audience. Although <em class="emphasis">Look</em> offered <em class="emphasis">Life</em> stiff competition during their almost identical print runs, the latter magazine is widely considered to have a greater legacy. Several other photo magazines—including <em class="emphasis">Focus</em>, <em class="emphasis">Peek</em>, <em class="emphasis">Foto</em>, <em class="emphasis">Pic</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Click</em>—also took their inspiration from <em class="emphasis">Life</em>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_p01">Although magazines’ great contributions to the development of culture and popular trends are today widely acknowledged, the industry has not always been influential. Because of the significant costs associated with printing and mailing publications, magazines originally reached out only to regional audiences. Not until these expenses declined and advertising revenues increased were magazines able to justify the cost of mass circulation.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Advertising for a National Market</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p01">The late 19th century brought with it an increase in mass circulation for the U.S. magazine industry. This meant that magazines that had once targeted only a small part of the country suddenly began reaching a nationwide audience. In addition to the obvious benefit of increased magazine revenue, this shift to broad circulation caused an interesting phenomenon: the introduction of national trends. For the first time in U.S. history, mass circulation allowed news, stories, consumer goods, and fashions to be diffused and advertised to widespread, rather than regional, audiences. Mass circulation of magazines united the country as geographically diverse consumers read the same stories and saw the same advertisements.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Due to this growth in readership, advertisements became increasingly vital to the magazine industry. Advertisers sought to reach a large audience, and magazines willingly afforded them that opportunity, selling advertising space at higher rates. One business manager of <em class="emphasis">Scribner’s Monthly</em>, an early popular magazine, solicited advertisements by discussing the readership boom:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p03">The publishers of <em class="emphasis">Scribner’s Monthly</em> will insert in each number of the magazine certain pages devoted to advertisements of a character likely to interest magazine readers. These will not increase the postage, while they will add materially to the ability of the publishers to render their magazines readable and attractive. The press of advertisements upon our first number shows how quickly the claims of the new monthly upon the business public are recognized. Our edition will be very large, and it will have a national circulation. It is now well understood that a first-class popular magazine furnishes to all men who seek a national market the very best medium for advertising that exists.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_022">Richard Ohmann, <em class="emphasis">Selling Culture: Magazines, Markets, and Class at the Turn of the Century</em> (New York: Verso, 1996), 26.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p04">That national market was an entirely new one for publishers and advertisers. By the 1930s, market research had become the norm for periodicals as magazines—and advertisers—worked to better understand what readers wanted in their publications. However, market research has its limits; many publishers instead embraced the potential of magazines to simply tell people what they want or need, thus solidifying the role of the magazine as a driver of popular culture. As one editor of <em class="emphasis">Vogue</em> articulated, “If we find out what people want, it’s already too late.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_023"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Popular Literature in Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Magazines offered a place not only for advertisers but also for authors and poets to reach a large audience. Several publications regularly hired both new and established authors to write stories. As circulation increased, so did the desire for these authors to publish their work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Literary magazines</a><span class="glossdef">A magazine that specializes in the publication of fictional stories.</span></span> enjoyed a boom during the 19th century, publishing some of the period’s most important fiction. At one point or another, nearly every important American writer contributed to literary magazines; for example, Edgar Allan Poe, Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, and Ernest Hemingway all published in periodicals throughout their careers. Even writers working outside the country such as Ezra Pound and James Joyce sought out U.S. magazines to publish works that had been banned elsewhere.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p03">Just as magazines offered authors a chance to display their writing to a large audience, they also allowed readers a taste of available literature. Even today, magazines print portions of books, which give readers a preview of the complete text. Portions of literary classics including <em class="emphasis">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</em>, <em class="emphasis">Walden</em>, <em class="emphasis">Moby-Dick</em>, <em class="emphasis">Tom Sawyer</em>, <em class="emphasis">Huckleberry Finn</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Ulysses</em> all made their debuts in magazines. Some novels—such as Edgar Rice Burroughs’s <em class="emphasis">Tarzan of the Apes</em>, John Hersey’s <em class="emphasis">Hiroshima</em>, and Ernest Hemingway’s <em class="emphasis">The Old Man and the Sea</em>—even appeared in magazines in full before being published in book form. The opportunity to publish in magazines has been invaluable for authors, but literary publications have also proved essential for the development of American culture. In publishing literary texts, journals have promoted now-classic stories, like the previously mentioned examples, that have defined American literary history and have shaped the U.S. story.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Pulp Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p01">During the late 1800s, a new type of magazine was established: the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pulp magazine</a><span class="glossdef">A publication that specializes in genre-fiction stories.</span></span>, an all-fiction publication named for its rough wood-pulp paper. At the time, dime novels did not qualify for the same inexpensive postal rates that magazines did—but the pulps did. Suddenly, individuals had the opportunity to read popular genre fiction in these cheap magazines, like <em class="emphasis">Adventure</em>, <em class="emphasis">Horror Stories</em>, <em class="emphasis">Startling Stories</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Weird Tales</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p02">Commonly acknowledged to be the invention of Frank Munsey, the pulps got their start as adventure magazines, but they eventually diverged into several categories such as love, detective, and western. The fiction stories did remarkably well until the mid-1930s, when newspaper comics first offered competition by printing collections on the same pulp paper. In 1937, however, the two genres collided with <em class="emphasis">Detective Comics</em> (where Batman made his first appearance), and the industry experienced a major boom. Although intended for children, the violent, horror-soaked comics drew a large adult audience. However, the graphic content of the pulp strips caused a stir, with the public divided on the nature of this new media. Defenders of the comics called them harmless, while critics thought they would provoke people to mimic the violent subject matter.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_024"><em class="emphasis">Encyclopaedia Britannica</em>, s.v. “History of Publishing,” <a class="link" href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/482597/publishing/28679/Magazine-publishing</a>.</span> Just as legislators struggle today with debates over censorship of television, music, and the Internet, they did so with pulp comics as well. Negative backlash against pulp comics was encouraged through several articles published by child psychologist Fredric Wertham, who alleged that comics were leading children into lives of crime.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_025">Jamie Coville, “The Comic Book Villain, Dr. Fredric Wertham, M.D.,” Seduction of the Innocents and the Attack on Comic Books, <a class="link" href="http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html">http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html</a>.</span> In response to the controversy, an industry group known as the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers established a Publishers Code in 1948 with the aim of regulating the content of pulp comics. The Publishers Code was not well enforced, however; many publishers choose to ignore the code, and thus the controversy continued to rage. When Senate hearings raised the threat of government regulation in 1954, the pulp comics industry opted for self-censorship, and as a result the much stricter Comics Code Authority was established to control what material reached consumers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s03_p03">In spite of the controversy surrounding the magazines, the industry flourished, and eventually new forms of pulp magazines emerged. <em class="emphasis">Amazing Stories</em> offered science fiction, and hand-drawn pinups filled so-called Girlie Pulps, which found an audience despite experiencing a setback in 1934 when police seized 10,000 copies and burned them. Even though both new genres attracted outcry from the public for their indecency, the pulps continued to grow in popularity. Many have argued that the difficulties of the Great Depression and the uncertainty of a looming world war made 1930s audiences ripe for the entertainment offered by fictional heroes, giving the pulp genre a ready audience.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Entertainment Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_p01">The success of the pulps encouraged another major transformation in mainstream journalism: the rise of entertaining <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fan magazines</a><span class="glossdef">A publication that provides audiences with a behind-the-scenes look at the entertainment industry.</span></span>. Typically focused on television, film, and music, fan magazines emerged as national entertainment during the early 20th century. During the early years of motion pictures, magazines such as <em class="emphasis">Photoplay</em>, <em class="emphasis">Picture Play</em>, <em class="emphasis">Movie Mirror</em>, and <em class="emphasis">Movieland</em> began publication, offering subscribers behind-the-scenes glimpses of well-known films. These periodicals were so successful that, as radio and television became popular, similar magazines came into existence to cover these new media. Television- and radio-focused magazines also provided weekly timetables of programs for their viewers and listeners. Although the emphasis of the fan magazine has changed over the years, even today much of the magazine industry is dominated by entertainment publications, like <em class="emphasis">Entertainment Weekly</em>, <em class="emphasis">Rolling Stone</em>, and <em class="emphasis">TV Guide</em>. In addition to providing entertainment news to readers, these publications are also useful to celebrities and media producers as a platform to market their new products.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p01">During the 1940s, many publishers began pursuing teenagers, a previously ignored demographic. <em class="emphasis">Seventeen</em> magazine hit shelves in 1944, setting the stage for later publications such as <em class="emphasis">Tiger Beat</em> and <em class="emphasis">Teen People</em>. These magazines targeted young women, offering stories on fashion, makeup, celebrity news, and lifestyles. Since their beginnings, teen magazines have kept their articles relatively brief, instead reaching their target audiences with bright and bold photos. <em class="emphasis">Tiger Beat</em>, for example, is known for its collaged covers featuring a popular teen celebrity of the moment. Teen magazines influence popular culture not only through their reporting on celebrities, but also through their articles on celebrity fashion, which readers use to adopt fashion trends worn by celebrities. Like entertainment magazines, teen magazines are also useful marketing tools for celebrities and other media producers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s02_s04_s01_p02">During their early years, most teen magazines sought out readers in their late teens, even offering articles on colleges. Today, however, to reach a wider audience, these same magazines intentionally target the preteen market by featuring younger actors and including more teenage celebrity gossip. In doing so, the magazine industry continues to influence younger and younger audiences, thus making a greater impact on American popular culture.</p>

According to fashion show organizers, “models had to be within a healthy weight range. That means a 5-foot-9 woman would need to be at least 125 pounds.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_026">Nanci Hellmich, “Do Thin Models Warp Girls’ Body Image?” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, September 26, 2006, <a class="link" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-09-25-thin-models_x.htm">http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-09-25-thin-models_x.htm</a>.</span> The debate over thin models has been around since the 1960s when model Twiggy entered the field. Since then, extremely thin models have ruled the runway despite claims to the contrary: Most American runway models measure within an inch or two of 6 feet tall, but weigh between just 120 and 124 pounds. With images of these models everywhere, many are growing concerned about their effect on American youths, especially teen girls.</p>

In one study, 69 percent of girls said that fashion models influence their idea of the perfect body shape, despite the fact that most models weigh 23 percent less than the average female.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_027"><em class="emphasis">Healthy Place</em>, “Eating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising,” December 11, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/">http://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/</a>.</span> Another study showed that 68 percent of Stanford University undergraduate and graduate students felt worse about themselves after looking through a women’s magazine.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_028"><em class="emphasis">Healthy Place</em>, “Eating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising,” December 11, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/">http://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/</a>.</span> Even more worrisome is the fact that young girls are being negatively affected by magazine images. “The number one wish for girls 11 to 17 is to be thinner, and girls as young as 5 have expressed fears of getting fat. Eighty percent of 10-year-old girls have dieted.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_029"><em class="emphasis">Healthy Place</em>, “Eating Disorders: Body Image and Advertising,” December 11, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/">http://www.healthyplace.com/eating-disorders/main/eating-disorders-body-image-and-advertising/menu-id-58/</a>.</span></p>

First popularized during the 1970s, these celebrity magazines offer readers an inside perspective on the lives of the famous. Many magazines publish gossip stories that humanize celebrities by featuring them in a negative light. Despite the best efforts of celebrities and their agents, placement in these magazines can make or break celebrities’ reputations and foster much drama within the celebrity community. Because of intense competition for stories, celebrity magazines may pay large sums of money to celebrities or other sources for exclusive stories and photos. Celebrity magazines will be discussed in detail later in this chapter.</p>

The magazine’s focus is similar to those of <em class="emphasis">Time</em> and <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, but <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> concentrates more on political, economic, health, and education stories, perhaps in part because it is based in Washington, DC.

            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p01">When <em class="emphasis">Time</em> cocreator Henry Luce launched <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em> in 1954, his staff was doubtful about its chances. Spectator sports had not yet reached the level of popularity they have today, and the new magazine failed to make a profit for its first 12 years of publication. As television brought spectator sports to the growing suburbs, however, their popularity quickly rose, and <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em> became a success. Managing editor Andre Laguerre assembled a staff of talented, loyal writers and instituted the extensive use of color photographs, developing the basis for the format the magazine still uses.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p02">In 1964, Laguerre initiated the <em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em> Swimsuit Edition as a way of increasing sales during the winter months when there are fewer developments in sports. Putting model Babette March on the cover in a bikini helped the magazine sell, and the swimsuit edition became an annual tradition. Filled with pictures of models in revealing swimwear, the issue generates its share of controversy but is consistently the best-selling issue of the magazine each year.</p>

        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s01_p02">In these four issues, the war in Iraq accounted for more than a fifth (22 percent) of all stories and roughly a third (32 percent) of all the space.

Interestingly, despite both publications’ stated commitment to news, a dramatic decrease took place in articles on domestic- and foreign-government affairs. Whether these changes reflected a change in reader interest or an alteration in the editors’ perspectives remains unclear; however, these shifts demonstrate that what is published is entirely up to the magazine and its editorial staff, as they are the ones who have the final word.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Advertisers’ Influence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p01">Magazines derive approximately half of their income from advertisers.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_068">“Magazines: Economics and Careers,” March 20, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm">http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm</a>.</span> With such a large stake in the magazine industry, advertisers can play a major role in deciding which stories are printed. Because magazines are so dependent on advertisers for their revenue, they are cautious about the content they place in their pages.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p02">Magazines tend to shy away from controversial content that can turn off advertisers. Recently, a large American auto manufacturer sent a memo to about 50 magazines asking that their ad agency be notified if future issues of the magazine contained articles that addressed political, sexual, or social issues that might be seen as provocative, controversial, or offensive.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_069">“Magazines: Economics and Careers,” March 20, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm">http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p03">The balance that magazines must maintain to keep advertisers happy is a delicate one. With ad prices driving the magazine industry, many publications are forced to satisfy advertisers by avoiding potentially controversial stories.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p04">Another anecdote about advertisers controlling stories illustrates how some publishers must conform to advertiser demands.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p05">In an even more blatant attempt to influence magazine content, another large corporation informed a number of magazine publishers that the content of their magazines would be carefully monitored for several months and that a large advertising contract would be awarded to the publication that portrayed their industry in the most favorable light.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_070">“Magazines: Economics and Careers,” March 20, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm">http://www.cybercollege.com/frtv/mag3.htm</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p06">With stories such as these, it may seem easy to paint the advertising industry as an evil, controlling entity that seeks to keep stories from the public. While advertisers may exhibit some control over stories, they also have a lot at stake.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s03_p07">As online media grows, today many advertisers are pulling their expensive print ads in favor of cheaper, web-based advertisements.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_071">David Knarr, “Magazine Advertising – Trade Secrets,” <a class="link" href="http://www.studio1productions.com/Articles/MagAds.htm">http://www.studio1productions.com/Articles/MagAds.htm</a>.</span> Advertising revenue has decreased steadily since the 1990s, mirroring the rise in online readership.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_072">“Periodicals: Publishing, or Publishing and Printing” <a class="link" href="http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/wood/periodicals-publishing-publishing-printing">http://business.highbeam.com/industry-reports/wood/periodicals-publishing-publishing-printing</a>.</span> This drop in advertising may, in fact, force magazines to give advertisers more control over their content to avoid losing further funding. While it may be difficult to precisely pin down the level of influence advertisers exert over magazine content, evidence suggests they do exert some control.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Editorial Leanings</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s04_p01">Each magazine has its own editorial slant, which helps determine which stories get published and how those stories are presented. A 2003 study examining leading newsmagazines <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>, and <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> verified these differences by demonstrating variations in how the publications presented their articles to the reading public.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s04_p02"><em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> … is the most information-laden, the most likely to publish highly traditional hard news topics and the most likely to report in a neutral manner—a more straightforward accounting of the facts of events with less of a writer’s “take” or opinion on what those events mean. <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> is lighter, more oriented toward lifestyle and celebrity coverage, and more likely to publish stories that contain an emotional component. <em class="emphasis">Time</em> magazine is something of a hybrid between the two. Its content is more like <em class="emphasis">U.S. News</em>’—neutral and information driven. Its covers, on the other hand, look a good deal more like <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em>’s—highlighting lifestyle and entertainment.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_073">Project for Excellence in Journalism, “Magazines” in <em class="emphasis">The State of the News Media 2004</em>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s04_p03">These distinctions among the three publications may seem slight, but they have an effect on the information contained between their covers. However, these editorial leanings do not make one magazine more prestigious or valid than the others; <em class="emphasis">U.S. News &amp; World Report</em> may offer facts and figures about a particular event, while <em class="emphasis">Newsweek</em> may provide the human side of the story. Readers should understand, though, that several variables affect the articles that they see in each publication.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Online News Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s04_s05_p01">The Internet has significantly changed the way that the public receives information. The advent of online news sources has somewhat lessened the control that magazines have over information. Today, several online-only magazines provide, for little to no cost, news and coverage that would have previously been available only through print publications. Online-only magazines include <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, which offers a daily digest of information from newspapers around the globe, and <em class="emphasis">Salon</em>, which provides readers many stories for free and more in-depth coverage for a subscription cost. Like their print counterparts, online magazines rely on revenue from advertisers, but because that advertising is less costly, advertisers may have less of a stake in online content. All these factors contribute to changing perspectives on the way that information is being controlled in the journalism industry.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_p01">Over the last century, magazines have slowly moved into more specialized, fragmented groupings. This transformation from general-interest to niche publications began with the popularization of television. To survive the threat posed by the success of broadcast media, print publications worked to stand out from their competitors by developing market niches. During this transition, magazine editors found that by specializing they were also appealing to advertisers hoping to reach specific audiences. No longer were ads just going out to the general public. Instead, advertisers could target groups by gender, age, race, class, and social and cultural interests.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_074">Richard Campbell, Christopher R Martin, Bettina Fabos, “Magazines in the Age of Specialization: Chapter Nine,” pp. 255–284, <em class="emphasis">Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.profbob.com/MCOM%2072/Media%20Culture%20TEXT/Media%20Culture%20PPTs/Chapter%209.ppt">http://www.profbob.com/MCOM%2072/Media%20Culture%20TEXT/Media%20Culture%20PPTs/Chapter%209.ppt</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_p02">From the medical field to the auto industry, specialization has become necessary to compete in an ever-growing market. Yet the trend is perhaps most obvious in mass media and in the publishing industry in particular. “In 2006, the Magazine Publishers of America trade organization listed more than 40 special categories of consumer magazines.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_075">Richard Campbell, Christopher R Martin, Bettina Fabos, “Magazines in the Age of Specialization: Chapter Nine,” pp. 255–284, <em class="emphasis">Media and Culture: An Introduction to Mass Communication</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.profbob.com/MCOM%2072/Media%20Culture%20TEXT/Media%20Culture%20PPTs/Chapter%209.ppt">http://www.profbob.com/MCOM%2072/Media%20Culture%20TEXT/Media%20Culture%20PPTs/Chapter%209.ppt</a>.</span> This wide variety of niche publications reflects the increasing specificity of markets and audiences. “In publishing, demand for specialized magazines and books can be evidenced by looking at the magazine rack. [There are] magazines focusing on photography to cars, to economics and foreign affairs and more.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_076">Jennifer Hess, “Specialization Trends in Business,” Helium.com, October 5, 2007, <a class="link" href="http://www.helium.com/items/664459-specialization-trends-in-business">http://www.helium.com/items/664459-specialization-trends-in-business</a>.</span> Specialization is likely to increase, rather than decrease. “Market fragmentation has and probably will continue to proliferate.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s01_p01">Nearly every trade group produces some sort of professional publication for its members. Many trade organizations even have their own libraries that house publications solely dedicated to their specific groups. For example, if a person wishes to find information on agriculture, forestry, fishing, and hunting organizations, the National Agricultural Library in Beltsville, Maryland, near Washington, DC, might offer a starting point. This library is one of four national libraries of the United States and has one of the world’s largest agricultural information collections and links a nationwide network of state land-grant and U.S. Department of Agriculture field libraries.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_078">Career Resource Library, CareerOneStop, <a class="link" href="http://www.acinet.org/crl/library.aspx?LVL2=99&amp;LVL3=n&amp;LVL1=58&amp;CATID=744&amp;PostVal=9">http://www.acinet.org/crl/library.aspx?LVL2=99&amp;LVL3=n&amp;LVL1=58&amp;CATID=744&amp;PostVal=9</a>.</span> This is but one example of the array of trade-group publications available.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p01">Academic journals have, in some form, been around since the early years of magazine publication. During the 17th century, the <em class="emphasis">Universal Historical Bibliothèque</em> became the first journal to invite scholarly contributions. Today, hundreds of scholarly journals exist, such as the <em class="emphasis">American Economic Review</em> and <em class="emphasis">The Journal of Marriage and Families</em>, and every academic field has its own array of journals to which scholars can contribute. Most university libraries allow students and faculty access to these journals via library databases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s02_p02">In every academic field, journals are ranked based on the types of articles they publish and on their selectiveness. Most academic journals use a peer-reviewing process to determine which articles are printed. During this process, a panel of readers reviews an anonymous article and then decides whether to accept the paper, accept with changes, or reject it altogether. Scholarly publication is essential for graduate students and university faculty members alike as they seek to disseminate their ideas and progress in their careers.</p>

But Christianity is not the only faith represented in periodicals. <em class="emphasis">Kashrus Magazine</em> targets the Jewish community, and <em class="emphasis">Shambhala Sun</em> is affiliated with the Buddhist faith. Additionally, certain magazines, such as <em class="emphasis">CrossCurrents</em>, are designed for people of all faiths.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s04_p01">Political groups also have capitalized on the magazine industry. Whether liberal or conservative, most people can find a publication that reflects their political opinions. Two such magazines are <em class="emphasis">The American Prospect</em> and <em class="emphasis">The American Conservative</em>. <em class="emphasis">The American Prospect</em> targets Democrats with “thoughtful views of America’s progressive liberal Democratic issues, ideas, politics and policy.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_080">“Top 10 Political Magazines,” <a class="link" href="http://AllYouCanRead.com">AllYouCanRead.com</a>, <a class="link" href="http://www.allyoucanread.com/top-10-political-magazines/">http://www.allyoucanread.com/top-10-political-magazines/</a>.</span> Conversely, <em class="emphasis">the American Conservative</em> is aimed at right-leaning individuals.

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s06_p01">Perhaps the most populated classification is that of hobby and special-interest magazines, a reflection of the wide array of hobbies and interests that different individuals enjoy. Within this classification of journals, one can find magazines on such topics as sports (<em class="emphasis">Sports Illustrated</em>), wellness (<em class="emphasis">Health</em>), cooking (<em class="emphasis">Bon Appétit</em>), home decoration and renovation (<em class="emphasis">This Old House</em>), and travel and geography (<em class="emphasis">National Geographic</em>).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s06_p02">Readers interested in specific hobbies can generally find a magazine that caters to them. Photographers, for example, can subscribe to the <em class="emphasis">British Journal of Photography</em>, the world’s longest-running photography magazine, in publication since 1854. This journal prints “profiles of emerging talent alongside star names, a picture-led Portfolio section, business analysis and detailed technology reviews.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_086"><em class="emphasis">British Journal of Photography</em>, “About Us,” <a class="link" href="http://www.bjp-online.com/static/about-us">http://www.bjp-online.com/static/about-us</a>.</span> Music enthusiasts can choose from an array of publications ranging from more general ones such as <em class="emphasis">Spin</em> and the <em class="emphasis">International Early Music Review</em> to highly specific such as the <em class="emphasis">Journal of the International Double Reed Society</em> and <em class="emphasis">Just Jazz Guitar</em>.

<em class="emphasis">Vogue</em> Crosses Media Lines</h3>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s06_p06">In recent years, <em class="emphasis">Vogue</em> has served as inspiration for two major films: <em class="emphasis">The Devil Wears Prada</em> (2006) and <em class="emphasis">The September Issue</em> (2009). Based on Lauren Weisberger’s novel of the same name, <em class="emphasis">The Devil Wears Prada</em> is a feature film about a young woman living in New York dreaming of becoming a magazine writer. She lands a job as the assistant to the city’s most ruthless magazine editor, Miranda Priestly—played by Meryl Streep—who runs <em class="emphasis">Runway</em> magazine, a fictionalized version of <em class="emphasis">Vogue</em>. This coming-of-age story highlights the work that goes into producing a magazine of such prestige. Streep was nominated for an Oscar award for her performance and, appropriately for a film about fashion, the costume designer was also nominated for Best Achievement in Costume Design.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s06_p07"><em class="emphasis">The September Issue</em> is a documentary chronicling <em class="emphasis">Vogue</em> Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour’s preparation for the 2007 fall fashion issue. Wintour, the editor upon whom Streep’s character in <em class="emphasis">The Devil Wears Prada</em> was loosely based,<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_089">Steven Zeitchik, “Meryl Streep and her ‘Devil Wears Prada’ Director Jump Into New Springs,” <em class="emphasis">24 Frames</em> (blog), <em class="emphasis">Los Angeles Times</em>, February 8, 2011, <a class="link" href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/02/meryl-streep-david-frankel-hope-springs-prada.html">http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2011/02/meryl-streep-david-frankel-hope-springs-prada.html</a>.</span> is well known for being a powerful influence on the fashion industry and a demanding editor. The film, however, humanizes her, while still demonstrating her obsession with fashion and with perfection in her magazine.</p>
            <p class="para" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s05_s06_p08">The success of both films reveals a fascination with the fashion and publishing industries. The fact that these two films would be released as the magazine industry is in decline is surprising but perhaps reflects an interest in journalism from a younger audience. The use of publishing as a topic in the film medium shows how magazines, though struggling, remain relevant and how special-interest magazines, like those in fashion, can transcend the medium and cross over into other mass media.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_p01">In March of 2010, <em class="emphasis">Consumerist</em> published a story titled “Print edition of <em class="emphasis">TV Guide</em> tells me to go online to read most of cover story.” According to the article, <em class="emphasis">TV Guide</em> printed a story listing “TV’s Top 50 Families,” but shocked readers by including only the top 20 families in its print version.

    <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_p02">Just like their newspaper cousins, magazines have been greatly affected by the influence of the Internet. With so much information available online, advertisers and readers are accessing content on the Internet, causing declines in both revenue and readership. These changes are forcing magazines to adapt to an increasingly online market.</p>
    <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Online-Only Magazines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p01">In 1995, <em class="emphasis">Salon</em> launched the first major online-only magazine at <a class="link" href="http://www.salon.com">http://www.salon.com</a>. “Salon, the award-winning online news and entertainment website, combines original investigative stories, breaking news, provocative personal essays and highly respected criticism along with popular staff-written blogs about politics, technology and culture.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_091"><em class="emphasis">Salon</em>, “Salon Fact Sheet,” <a class="link" href="http://www.salon.com/press/fact/">http://www.salon.com/press/fact/</a>.</span> Like many print magazines, the site divides content into sections including entertainment, books, comics, life, news and politics, and technology and business. With an average of 5.8 million monthly unique visitors, this online magazine demonstrates the potential successes of Internet-based publications.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_092"><em class="emphasis">Salon</em>, “Salon Fact Sheet,” <a class="link" href="http://www.salon.com/press/fact/">http://www.salon.com/press/fact/</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p02">Other online-only magazines include <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> and <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>. All three magazines, like most online publications, support themselves in part through ads that appear alongside articles and other content. Founded in 1996, <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> is a “general interest publication offering analysis and commentary about politics, news, and culture.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_093"><em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, “About Us: Everything you need to know about <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>,” <a class="link" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/">http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/</a>.</span> Considering itself “a daily magazine on the Web,” <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> offers its readers information on news and politics, arts, life, business, technology, and science via online articles, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">podcasts</a><span class="glossdef">Audio content broadcast over the Internet.</span></span>, and blogs.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_094"><em class="emphasis">Slate</em>, “About Us: Everything you need to know about <em class="emphasis">Slate</em>,” <a class="link" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/">http://www.slate.com/id/2147070/</a>.</span> The successful magazine has been recognized with numerous awards for its contributions to journalism.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> differs somewhat from <em class="emphasis">Slate</em> or <em class="emphasis">Salon</em> in that it was originally a print publication. First published in 1982, the computer magazine published hard-copy issues for over 15 years before announcing in 2008 that its January 2009 issue would be its last printed edition. In an open letter to its readers, <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> discussed the transition:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p04">Starting in February 2009, <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> will become a 100-percent digital publication. So, in addition to our popular network of Websites … we’ll offer <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine Digital Edition</em> to all of our print subscribers. The <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine Digital Edition</em> has actually been available since 2002. So for thousands of you, the benefits of this unique medium are already clear. And those benefits will continue to multiply in the coming months, as we work hard to enhance your digital experience.<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_095">Lance Ulanoff, “<em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em> Goes 100% Digital,” (2008), <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>, <a class="link" href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_p05">While it is perhaps fitting that this computer-focused publication is one of the first print magazines to move to an entirely online form, its reasons for the transition were financial rather than creative. In describing the decision, Jason Young, chief executive of Ziff Davis Media, said, “[t]he viability for us to continue to publish in print just isn’t there anymore.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_096">Stephanie Clifford, “<em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>, a Flagship for Ziff Davis, Will Cease Printing a Paper Version,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, November 19, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/business/media/20mag.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/20/business/media/20mag.html</a>.</span> Unfortunately for the magazine industry, Young’s sentiment reflects a trend that has been building for some time. Several other publications have followed in <em class="emphasis">PC Magazine</em>’s footsteps, making the move from print to online-only. Journals such as <em class="emphasis">Elle Girl</em> and <em class="emphasis">Teen People</em> that were once available in print can now be viewed only via the Internet. As printing costs rise and advertising and subscription revenues decrease, more magazines will likely be making similar shifts.</p>
        <div class="section" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_s01" version="5.0" lang="en">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Magazine-Like Websites</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s01_s01_p01">In recent years, websites that function much as magazines once did without officially being publications themselves have become an increasingly popular online model. For example, Pitchfork Media is an Internet publication on the music industry. Established in 1995, the site offers readers criticism and commentary on contemporary music and has many of the same features as a traditional music magazine: reviews, news, articles, and interviews. Whether the site is capitalizing on the success of print magazines by following their format or if it is simply responding to its readers by providing them with an accessible online experience is a debatable point. Of course, the website also has many features that would not be available in print, such as a streaming playlist of music and music videos. This hybrid of magazine-like content with new-media content offers a possible vision of the digital future of print publications.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Print Magazines with Online Presences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p01">Indeed, most print magazines have created websites. Nearly every major print publication has a site available either for free or through subscription. Yet there are intrinsic differences between the print and online media. Bernadette Geyer, author of a poetry chapbook, <em class="emphasis">What Remains</em>, discusses the practical contrasts between online and print journals:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block">
            <p class="para editable" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p02">I will read a print journal cover to cover because I can bookmark where I left off…. Simply taking all the of the content of what would have been a print issue and putting it online with links from a Table of Contents is all well and good in theory, but I have to ask, how many people actually sit and read all of the contents of an online journal that publishes several authors/genres per issue?<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_097">Bernadette Geyer, “Online vs. Print Journal Models,” <em class="emphasis">Bernadette Geyer: Livin’ the Literary Life in the Exiles of Suburbia</em> (blog), March 9, 2010, <a class="link" href="http://bernadettegeyer.blogspot.com/2010/03/online-vs-print-journal-models.html">http://bernadettegeyer.blogspot.com/2010/03/online-vs-print-journal-models.html</a>.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p03">Her question is a good one, and one which most magazines have already asked themselves. In light of this dilemma, magazines with online editions have sought ways to attract readers who may not, in fact, read much. Most websites also include online-only content such as blogs, podcasts, and daily news updates that, naturally, are not available in print form. The additional features on magazines’ websites likely stem from a need to attract audiences with shorter attention spans and less time to devote to reading entire articles.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s02_p04">Another way that magazines court online readers is by offering back-issue content. Readers can browse old articles without having to remember in which issue the content first appeared. The cost for this varies from publication to publication. For example, <a class="link" href="http://CooksIllustrated.com">CooksIllustrated.com</a> reprints recipes from previous issues as part of a paid online membership service, while <a class="link" href="http://CookingLight.com">CookingLight.com</a> offers back issues for free. Some magazines have online archive collections, though those collections generally do not print entire articles or complete issues. <em class="emphasis">Time</em>, for example, offers “hand-picked covers and excerpts from the best articles on a wide variety of subjects.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_098"><em class="emphasis">Time</em>, “<em class="emphasis">Time</em> Magazine Archives,” <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/">http://www.time.com/time/archive/</a>.</span> <em class="emphasis">Time</em> suggests that one should “use them as chronological guides to <em class="emphasis">Time</em>’s past coverage of a person, event, or topic.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_099"><em class="emphasis">Time</em>, “<em class="emphasis">Time</em> Magazine Archives,” <a class="link" href="http://www.time.com/time/archive/">http://www.time.com/time/archive/</a>.</span> Still, even without the entire collection online, there is a distinct benefit of being able to search back for articles from 1923 from a computer.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s03_p01">The question <em class="emphasis">Is print dead?</em> has dominated the magazine and newspaper industries for several years. In 2008, <em class="emphasis">The New York Times</em> printed an article titled “Mourning Old Media’s Decline,” in which author David Carr describes multiple announcements of job loss in the print industry. Thousands of individuals working at magazines and newspapers faced layoffs because of reduced subscriber and advertiser demand. “Clearly the sky is falling,” he writes, “The question now is how many people will be left to cover it.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_100">David Carr, “Mourning Old Media’s Decline,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 28, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html</a>.</span> At the same time, Carr articulates the shift in readership from print to web, saying, “The paradox of all these announcements is that newspapers and magazines do not have an audience problem—newspaper websites are a vital source of news, and growing—but they do have a consumer problem.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_101">David Carr, “Mourning Old Media’s Decline,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, October 28, 2008, <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/business/media/29carr.html</a>.</span> With a majority of magazines and newspapers now available for free online, one has to wonder how the industry will stay afloat. Although advertisements pay for a portion of the cost of running a magazine, it may not be enough.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s03_p02">The debate over whether print is still viable is a heated one that is infiltrating the magazine industry.

In a 2005 published debate on the topic, former print editor-turned-blogger Jeff Jarvis squared off against John Griffin, president of the National Geographic Society’s magazine group. Jarvis claimed, “Print is not dead. Print is where words go to die.” But Griffin countered, “Actually print is where words go to live—we’re still reading the ancient Greeks.”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_104">Jeff Jarvis and John Griffin, “Is Print Doomed?” <em class="emphasis">Fast Company</em>, December 1, 2005, <a class="link" href="http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/open-debate-extra.html">http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/101/open-debate-extra.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="lulemedia_1.0-ch05_s06_s03_p03">Regardless of your position, the fact that the print industry is facing hardships is unquestionable. Magazines are rethinking their marketing strategies to remain viable in an increasingly online world. But many are hopeful that journals will find a way to publish both in print and on the Internet. After all, “[t]here’s something special and unique, even luxurious about reading a big, glossy magazine…. Or, in the words of <em class="emphasis">Marie Claire</em> editor Joanna Coles, ‘As long as people take baths, there will always be a monthly magazine.’”<span class="footnote" id="lulemedia_1.0-fn05_105">Dorian Benkoil and Dylan Stableford, “Is Print Dead?
